## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Design Outline


#### Misc

- Some spillover due to site closeness, but this would only bias our estimated downwards.


# Design

## Site Identification

Inclusion/Exclusion criteria.  To identify eligible sites, we undertook a scoping exercise to determine if the two communities in an implementation site had a demonstrated need for a peacebuilding program and were willing to participate in one.  We defined “demonstrated need” as the communities engaging in violent clashes within one year of the scoping exercise. Willingness to participate in the program was obtained through conversations with community leaders, none of whom refused the program.  

## Intervention

Intervention with two communities in conflict.
Details of ECPN.  Intergroup contact, including leaders of each group.^[Leaders of each group also received mediation training.]  Groups first meet _separately_ to prepare them to be brought together.

## Evaluation

Two complementary comparisons: (1) randomly assigned treatment communities compared to randomly assigned control communities, and (2) non-randomly assigned participants in treatment 

## Outcomes

**Attitudes**
Intergroup Trust: self-report
Intergroup affect: survey experiments

**Behaviors**
Cooperation: PGG
Intergroup contact: self-report, markets/social events

**Violence**
Physical insecurity: self-report
Violence experienced: self-report

**Mechanisms**
Dispute Resolution: resolution index
Threat: threat index
Ingroup expansion: social cohesion 1
Intergroup empathy: social cohesion 2
