# Thinking


**Intro**

Need to explain why I am doing things more than tell people details of what I am doing.  Only provide broad strokes for what I did.

Field experiment papers often take a couple paragraphs talking about the field experiment, but I don't want to.

Big framing points:

- Psych reconciliation can be effective at reducing real world conflict.
- Mechanism seems to be intergroup contact, which increases intergroup trust.  Trust has many positive consequences.

## Introduction

<!--## Motivating Example
Story about burnt down village/bad outcomes-->
Intergroup conflict is responsible for many of the worst displays of human nature.  In Nigeria's Middlebelt, intergroup conflict between farmers and pastoralists claimed 7000 lives in the past five years, forced 180,000 people from their homes in 2018, and costs Nigeria $13 billion of lost economic productivity annually [@council2019nigeria; @daniel2018anti; @mcdougal2015effect].  In the most recent conflict escalation, groups of anti-pastoralist vigilantes mobilized to pre-emptively prevent pastoralists from encroaching on land claimed by farmers [@duru2018court; @mcdonnel2017graze].  These groups, dubbed the "livestock guard", ransacked pastoralist settlements and violently drove pastoralists from their homes, often with the assistance of the local farming community.  Likewise, pastoralist groups enacted vigilante justice, raiding and burning down farming villages seen to encroach on land claimed by pastoralists. <!-- In both cases, neighbors often assisted as the other group was forced to flee their homes-->

<!--Story about village defending pastoralists. chris: write first few sentences better.-->

Though farmer-pastoralist conflict was widespread, mass violence did not break out between these groups in all Middlebelt communities.  In one village, farmers and pastoralists defended each other from hostile neighbors.  When a group of livestock guard came for one pastoralist settlement, the neighboring farming village arrested them to protect the pastoralists.  After the arrest, farmers and pastoralists convened to decide what should be done with the prisoners.  They agreed that the group of livestock guard should not be punished, but should be disarmed and released home -- a proposition proposed by _the pastoralists_.  These farmers and pastoralists had also struggled with conflict, and people on both sides had died in past violence over farmland and grazing land.  But their recent disputes had not escalated to the point that each side wanted the other removed by any means necessary.  They had created structures and relationships that allowed them to settle disputes, and the same structures and relationships allowed them to reach a solution about the livestock guard.

<!--What accounts for the difference? signposting theoretical argument & psych literature: prejudice & trust, bargaining, intergroup contact, social spillover, superordinate goals. Intergroup conflict fuels and is fueled by intergroup prejudice.  -->

Why were some farmer and pastoralist groups able to keep peace whereas others were swallowed by the escalating conflict?  Why were some communities able to overcome their disputes whereas others were destroyed by them?  These questions are not unique to Nigeria -- similar intergroup dynamics spurred violence in South Sudan, Myanmar, and Bosnia before those conflicts escalated into war.  Understanding the factors that help groups resolve their disputes is important to mitigate and defuse the myriad intergroup conflicts around the world.  Using the framework of intergroup conflict as a bargaining failure, we argue that increasing cooperative contact between groups during an ongoing conflict can increase intergroup trust and physical security.  In situations of low trust, groups are essentially locked into a mutually-defecting Prisoner's Dilemma because each side assumes the other will defect, even if one side cooperated first.  Interventions that increase opportunities for cooperative contact can improve the prospects for peace by helping the groups update their perceptions of each other's trustworthiness.  Intergroup trust ameliorates bargaining problems and increases the likelihood of the groups resolving disputes through bargaining instead of violence.  <!--Peacebuilding programs can help conflicting groups achieve trust through intergroup contact and superordinate goals.-->

<!--## Relevant Literature
Intergroup conflict is a bargaining problem exacerbated by lack of intergroup trust.  Groups do not trust each other to honor comittments and worry that the other group is deceiving.   -->

Intergroup conflict is often conceptualized as a bargaining problem [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war].  Both groups want some resource -- land, power, etc -- and must decide how to distribute that resource.  Groups can either bargain and split the resource, or groups can fight to claim all of the resource or to increase their bargaining position later.  Fighting is costly, so both groups are better off finding a bargained solution than fighting.  However, bargaining fails if neither group trusts the other side to be truthful or to honor bargained agreements [@rohner2013war;@kydd2000trust;@rohner2013war].  Without a reason to trust in the other side, groups are likely to remain in conflict.

<!--How IR tends to think about solving the trust problem: top-down, some external actor.  Hobbes' Leviathan. -->

How can groups in conflict escape this spiral of distrust and conflict?  The classic answer is a strong external actor that can increase the cost of fighting, punish defections from bargained agreements, and facilitate information flows [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war; @doyle2000international; @ostrom2003trust].  <!--Could remove rest of paragraph based on RW suggestion -->For many conflicts, international actors fulfill those role through military intervention and mediation [@doyle2000international; @di2017effectiveness].  By providing reliable information and punishing defection from agreements, international intervention helps conflicting actors overcome the bargaining failures that lead to violent conflict [@fearon1994ethnic; @fearon1995rationalist; @powell2006war; @smith2003mediation].  If a strong external actor punishes groups for defecting, each side can trust the other to abide by their agreement because abiding by their agreement is in each group's self-interest.  A strong external actor serves as a substitute for the trust the groups lack.

<!--Why we cannot use external actors everywhere. -->

<!--Would also remove first sentence here and then merge with previous paragraph -->While not universally successful, military intervention and mediation are effective strategies to promote peace in many conflicts [@doyle2000international; @walter2002committing; @hartzell2001stabilizing; @gartner2011signs; @wallensteen2014talking].  But strong external actors guaranteeing peace are not desirable or possible everywhere.  Intervening as an external actor is costly, and often there are no external actors strong enough or interested enough to intervene [@kydd2006can; @fey2010shuttle].  This is especially true for the persistent intercommunal and sectarian violence that plagues states without the power or interest to intervene in the conflict.<!--In many such conflicts, the conflicting groups are not united and therefore it is not clear who is involved in bargaining and who the external actor should punish if one side defects.-->  Where an external actor is available, its presence is a short-term peace solution and its effects do not endure with the external actor's departure [@rohner2013war; @beardsley2008agreement; @weinstein2005autonomous].  <!--In fact, external actor can make it more difficult to create social norms that sustain peace long-term [@ostrom2000collective; @frey1994intrinsic; @rohner2013war].  -->With or without external actors to halt the conflict, the groups must eventually build trust rather than find a substitute for trust.

<!--RW: Instead, most interventions to address these types of conflicts focus on bottom-up approaches, often based on contact theory and specifically the condition of working on a cooperative goal (Allport 1954). Peacebuilding programs utilizing intergroup contact and superordinate goals are increasingly used to reduce intergroup conflict by peacebuilding organizations (Ditlmann, Samii, and Zeitzoff 2017).For example, the US government spends $26M a year on programs based on contact theory to prevent and mitigate violence. -->

<!--How prejudice exacerbates trust problems and thwarts intergroup trust -->

Increasing trust amidst conflict is difficult, however, for psychological reasons.  Group conflicts are often driven and perpetuated by animosity and distrust long after the original grievance is forgotten [@mcdonnel2017graze; cite more about intergroup conflict].  Animosity can be an insurmountable barrier to peace for direct and indirect reasons.  Directly, these groups are less likely to trust information they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from the other side.  In this way, animosity directly inhibit intergroup bargaining and prevents peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Indirectly, animosity biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup behavior, preventing each group from updating and improving their trust in the other.  Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent actions as defensive and justified, whereas behavior by outgroup members may be perceived as more threatening and more malicious than the same behavior committed by a neutral party [@hewstone1990ultimate; cite fundamental/ultimate attribution error, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, anchoring bias].  The perceived negative behavior may be seen as _defining_ of the group, whereas any perceived positive behavior may be seen as the _exception_ to the group [@allison1985group; @pettigrew1979ultimate].  This biased information processing reinforces negative group stereotypes and can subvert the groups' own attempts to foster peace.  It can also sabotage intergroup bargaining by causing the groups to have inaccurate beliefs about each other and each other's willingness to make peace, adding to information and commitment problems that cause conflict.  <!--chris: I like this paragraph but think it could be a tiny bit clearer.-->

Existing strategies to reduce intergroup conflict do not foster trust.  One approach to improving intergroup trust comes from intergroup contact theory.  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will improve intergroup relations.  Intergroup contact works by demystifying the outgroup, presenting the other group's perspective, and replacing imagined stereotypes with firsthand knowledge [@allport1954prejudice; @pettigrew2008does].  This type of structured face-to-face contact also provides groups the opportunity to send costly signals about their trustworthiness and preference for peace [@kydd2000trust; @lupia1998democratic; @rohner2013war].<!--@bohnet1999social increases trust to see other player -->    Intergroup contact is likely especially good at reducing intergroup conflict when groups cooperate to achieve superordinate goals -- goals that require the cooperation of both groups and benefit both groups -- because groups experience the material benefits of cooperation [@sherif1958superordinate; @gaertner2000reducing].  

The effectiveness of intergroup contact has been demonstrated in a variety of contexts and using a variety of methodological approaches [@paluck2017contact; @pettigrew2006meta].  Notably, intergroup contacted programs reduced prejudice between white people and black people in the U.S. and South Africa [@marmaros2006friendships; @burns2015interaction], Jews and Arabs [@yablon2012we; @ditlmann2016can], and Hindus and Muslims [@barnhardt2009near].  In Nigeria, a recent study found that intergroup contact between Muslims and Christians decreased discrimination relative to a group that experienced _intra_group contact, suggesting that intergroup contact can work by countering the adverse effects of ingroup-only experiences [@scacco2018nigeria].  Peacebuilding programs utilizing intergroup contact and superordinate goals are increasingly used to reduce intergroup conflict by peacebuilding organizations [@ditlmann2017addressing].

Although research shows support for intergroup contact theory generally, its efficacy to reduce prejudice amid real-world conflict is an open question.  First, most research about intergroup contact uses correlational studies or lab experiments, both of which have methodological weaknesses.  Correlational studies cannot demonstrate causal effects, and results from lab experiments may not apply to real world conflicts, where groups compete for resources and share a history of intergroup violence [@ditlmann2017addressing].  Second, no prior studies of intergroup contact have involved groups engaged in active intergroup violence^[Previous studies have involved groups with a recent history of violent conflict but not groups involved in an active conflict. See @scacco2018nigeria and @ditlmann2016can for examples.], and some studies suggest that intergroup contact in violent settings could be ineffective or even backfire.  Negative experiences with outgroups increase prejudice, and the most prejudiced individuals are most likely to interpret intergroup contact negatively [@paolini2010negative; @gubler2013humanizing].  Despite a lack of evidence about the effects of contact-based peacebuilding programs in violent contexts, and the risks of programs going badly, peacebuilding organizations implement numerous contact-based interventions in violent contexts each year.  These peacebuilding programs might defuse intergroup conflict, but these programs also might do more harm than good.

<!--Say what we did in context of farmer-pastoralist conflict.  Some context, some intervention design (contact, mediation), some evaluation.-->

To study the effect of bottom-up peacebuilding interventions on violent conflict, we conduct a field experiment with farmer and pastoralist communities in Nigeria to determine if an intergroup contact-based program effectively increases intergroup trust and increases the physical security of group members.  We randomly assigned communities with farmer-pastoralist violence to receive the peacebuilding intervention or serve as a control group.  The intervention formed mixed-group committees and provided them with funds to build infrastructure that would benefit both communities; committees then collaboratively chose and constructed infrastructure projects.^[The communities built boreholes, market stalls, primary health care facilities, etc.]  The program also provided mediation training to each community's leaders and held forums where the groups discussed the underlying drivers of conflict.  To measure the effects of the intervention, we conducted pre- and post-intervention surveys, a post-intervention natural public goods behavioral game,[^PGG] and twelve months of systematic observations in markets and social events during the intervention.

[^PGG]: In a public goods game (PGG), research subjects are given money and told they can keep the money or donate it to a public fund.  Money donated to the public fund is multiplied by some amount and then shared with all subjects.  Our PGG is _natural_ because it was conducted in a natural setting, rather than a lab.  The funding for the PGG came from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1656871.

<!--Say what we found.  It seems primarily through intergroup contact.  -->

We find that the program increased intergroup trust, intergroup contact, and perceptions of physical security.  Compared to the control group, the treatment group expressed more outgroup trust and more willingness to interact with outgroup members.  The treatment group was also less prevented by violence from engaging in routine tasks, such as working, going to the market, and getting water.  The results also suggests that intergroup contact for a relatively small percentage of a group can indirectly affect attitudes of group members with no exogenous increase in contact with the outgroup.  We observe the most positive changes from individuals directly involved in the intergroup committees, but we also observe positive spillovers of trust to group members who were not involved in the intergroup contact intervention.

<!--Say implications for: (1) conflict resolution, especially intergroup and intercommunal violence.  On the rise, Fulani being massacred in Mali (Economist March 30, 2019).  <!--(4) peacebuilding programs and CDD, -->

This study expands our knowledge about intergroup conflict in several ways.  First, this study teaches us about the capacity of contact-based peacebuilding programs to improve intergroup relations.  To our knowledge this is the first field experimental test of a contact-based peacebuilding program implemented during an active conflict.  We evaluated the program's effects on both attitudinal and behavioral outcomes.  The results suggest that contact-based peacebuilding programs can effectively improve relationships between conflicting groups and is especially relevant to conflict resolution in the cases of intergroup and intercommunal conflicts.

<!--(2) intergroup contact theory, -->

Second, this study is one of the few field experimental interventions to test intergroup contact theory with groups actively engaged in violence.  Each of the groups in our study were part of an active and escalating conflict, with members of each side being killed within one year of the intervention's onset.  Even in such a context, community members who engaged in direct interpersonal interaction with an outgroup member changed more positively than other community members.  Importantly, the intergroup contact involved achieving superordinate goals that benefited both groups materially.  This suggests that contact with superordinate goals is robust to actively violent contexts.

<!--(5) spillover of effects and social norms/vicarious learning.  <!--(3) social institutions constraining behavior, intergroup bargaining -->

Third, we contribute to the literature about the role of social diffusion and informal institutions in shaping attitudes and behaviors.  Bottom-up peacebuilding interventions seek to provide a structure in which groups can solve their own conflicts, and those structures are informal rather than formal.  Understanding how those informal structures form and shape attitudes, norms, and behaviors of the wider population addresses the questions of scale for these programs.

<!--Fulani getting cleansed -->

Fourth, this paper's focus on farmer-pastoralist conflict is especially important because the pastoralists are of the Fulani ethnic group.  The Fulani are the largest semi-nomadic people on Earth, but their way of life makes them targets for violence throughout Africa.  Along with this conflict in Nigeria, Fulani in Mali have been the targets of violence so severe that researchers at Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project called it "ethnic cleansing" [@economist2019militias].  Understanding how to prevent conflict between Fulani and settled peoples can help prevent the eradication of a people and their way of life.

<!--Roadmap.-->

In the next section we provide a theoretical framework for how and why bottom-up interventions that focus on intergroup contact can improve trust and security.  We then discuss Nigeria's farmer-pastoralist conflict, our experimental intervention, and two designs to evaluate the effect of the intervention.  Last we present the results of the study and conclude by connecting these findings to theories of group conflict and prejudice.

<!--
## Old

In the farmer-pastoralist case, no such intervention was present or likely.  The conflict is rural and unknown to most of the international community.     Far from being an unbiased mediator, the state intervened _on behalf of farmers_.

## Quotes From Articles

"The problem is bigger than mandates and resources. Above all, it has to do with two strategic choices the UN frequently makes: first, to work with national elites to stop violence from the top down and, second, to push for quick elections as a way to consolidate the peace. The standard UN approach to ending wars is to host large, costly conferences in order to strike agreements between governments and rebel leaders and then organize a national vote and declare victory. Both tendencies are based on faulty assumptions."

The weakness of the top-down approach is that warfare is often the result of not just national or international competition but local competition, too. In many conflict zones, the fight is over such issues as land, water, livestock, and low-level traditional and administrative power.

**Consider the island of Idjwi, in Lake Kivu in eastern Congo. Since war broke out in Congo in 1996, a conflict that has killed anywhere from two million to five million people, Idjwi has avoided the brunt of the violence, even as other islands in nearby lakes have not. Idjwi has all the same factors that have fueled fighting around it: a geostrategic location, mineral resources, ethnic tensions, a lack of state authority, extreme poverty, disputes over land and traditional power. But the island’s residents, including the poorest and least powerful, have set up various grass-roots organizations—religious networks, women’s associations, youth groups, and so on—to help resolve disputes. They also draw on strong traditional beliefs—for example, forming blood pacts through which different families promise never to hurt one another. They have worked to foster what they call a “culture of peace.”**

The UN currently views such bottom-up peace-building efforts as a sideshow. Instead, it should see them as an essential complement to its current top-down efforts to stop fighting.

"bottom-up strategies that [let] the people themselves determine how best to promote peace."

[@autesserre2017international]

"international enforcement can help solve commitment and cooperation problems by imposing order or by directly implement- ing peace agreements or raising the costs of defection from them. Long-term trusteeship may be required to overcome deep distrust and powerful incentives to defect from the peace. As in prisoner's dilemma and mixed motive games (Axelrod and Keohane 1985; Oye 1985), deep hostility, multiple factions, or lack of coherent leadership may complicate the achievement of self-enforcing cooperation. Conscious direction by an impartial agent to guarantee the functions of effec- tive sovereignty become necessary, [@doyle2000international]


@kydd2000trust: opportunity for costly signaling allows groups to build trust and cooperate.  @ostrom2000collective, @Axelrod: conditional cooperators. Need to forgive.

@ostrom2000collective: "if there is a noisy signal about a player’s type that is at least more accurate than random, trustworthy types will survive as a substantial proportion of the population. Noisy signals may result from seeing one another, face-to-face communication, and various mechanisms that humans have designed to monitor each other’s behavior"
"evidence has accumulated that externally imposed rules tend to “crowd out” endogenous cooperative behavior (Frey, 1994)"
"These studies typically find that **a social norm**, especially in a setting where there is communication
between the parties, can work as well or nearly as well at generating cooperative
behavior as an externally imposed set of rules and system of monitoring and
sanctioning." @rohner2013war also says that coercive peace policies do not have enduring effects. @beardsley2008agreement says peacekeeping only works short-term.
@rohner2013war: lack of trust causes civil conflict.  Intergroup trust increases intergroup trade, which increases costs of conflict.


UN peacekeeping not successful at ending _ongoing_ conflicts, but are successful at post-conflict stuff. [@gilligan2008interventions; @doyle2006making]. @bratt1996assessing also questions effectiveness at conflict resolution.  @beardsley2008agreement shows mediation works short-term but not long-term.

@di2017effectiveness good summary of peacekeeping stuff.

@grieg2008they about mediation.
@regan2002third questions effectiveness of international intervention overall.
