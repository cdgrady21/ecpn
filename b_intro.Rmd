## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed (conflict driver).
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict (conflict consequence).
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

- The program maintained contact in treatment sites even as contact evaporated due to conflict in control sites.

Conflict over resources/ groups with a material reason for conflict.

## Intro Outline


The contact centers on joint goals that materially benefit both communities, which may be key.

## Introduction

Does intergroup contact reduce prejudice and conflict in contexts of intergroup violence?  Direct intergroup contact interventions are often applied to reduce real-world conflict between groups.  These real-world conflicts are defined by active violence and resource competition.  Despite a plethora of research about intergroup contact and widespread use of intergroup contact in violent contexts, we have almost no evidence about the effects of intergroup contact in violent contexts or where economic imperatives push groups apart.^[ScaccoNote]  Can intergroup contact overcome prejudice when the groups are engaged in active conflict over resources?

[^ScaccoNote]: A notable exception is the @Scacco2016 in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact.  That study also showed null effects for intergroup contact but negative effects for intragroup contact.  That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and the intervention sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

Decades of research demonstrate that intergroup contact _can_ reduce group-level prejudice in a variety of contexts.  Intergroup contact reduces prejudice towards different racial and ethnic groups groups [@katz1978race; @marmaros2006friendships; @burns2015interaction; @yablon2012we], different religious groups [@barnhardt2009near; @yablon2012we;@Scacco2016], women [@finseraas2016women], people with physical disabilities [@krahe2006disabled], gay people [@grutzeck1997effects], immigrants [@finseraas2017does], and other groups [see @paluck and @pettigrew for reviews].  None of these studies, however, involve groups in active conflict or groups competing for resources; few of these studies involve adults beyond college age. <!--Clause about adults may be unnecessary and/or distracting.-->

Active conflict and economic competition could prevent contact's positive effects, and may even cause contact to increase prejudice.  Active conflict and economic competition give group members a material motivation for prejudice and hate.  In an active conflict, the groups have materially damaged each other.  In economic competition, one group's gain is the other group's loss.  Both situations are common in conflicts worldwide, but scholars have yet to grapple with how these conditions affect intergroup contact or test intergroup contact in these contexts.  Contact theory suggests that contact should work in these contexts, provided the contact itself is conducted under proper conditions.  If the contact allows group members to (i) cooperate towards (ii) common goals in an (iii) equal status context with the (iv) support of authorities, contact should reduce prejudice.  Even when the groups are currently in conflict and competition, contact should provide experiences that reduce stereotypes [@allport1954prejudice; @gaertner2014reducing], reduce anxiety and uncertainty [@lee2001mere; @page2008little; @paolini2004effects], and increase empathy [@pettigrew2008does; @broockman2016durably] towards the outgroup.  

But will contact effectively reduce prejudice when the wider social context promotes group conflict?  Other perspectives on intergroup prejudice, like realistic group conflict theory [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave], and psychological theories like motivated reasoning [@klein1992motiated] and cognitive dissonance [@gubler2011diss], would not predict improved relations from intergroup contact in this context.  Intergroup contact does not change the underlying causes of prejudice -- competition over indivisible resources -- or change the resultant history of violence that feeds outgroup prejudice and whose justification requires outgroup prejudice.  In these contexts, any intergroup contact may increase prejudice because group members may be motivated to interpret intergroup interactions negatively [@paolini2010negative; @klein1992motiated], and the cognitive dissonance generated from even positive intergroup contact may cause a backlash effect that increases prejudice [@gubler2011diss].

We also want effects of intergroup contact for some ingroup members to diffuse to other ingroup members who have no contact.  The most prejudiced individuals will probably avoid contact, but if effects of contact from other ingroup members diffuse to these very prejudiced individuals -- either through vicarious/imagined contact or through social norm transmission -- intergroup contact could reduce prejudice even for individuals who do not engage in intergroup contact.

Farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria's Middlebelt is an ideal context to learn about the effect of intergroup contact on intergroup attitudes in a conflict environment.  As Nigeria's population expands and arable land recedes, economic imperatives have pushed subsistence farmers and pastoralists into a deadly conflict.  Though far more attention is paid towards Boko Haram in Nigeria's northeast, repercussions of farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria's middlebelt are just as significant.  As a result of the conflict, Nigeria's middlebelt, a mostly rural region considered Nigeria's breadbasket and home to nearly 100 vibrant people's and cultures, has suffered an estimated 60,000 deaths [@obaji2016war], hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people's [@icg2017herder; @daniel2018anti], and loses $13 billion of economic productivity annually [@mcdougal2015effect], greatly stressing Nigeria's economic and social infrastructure.  Farmer-pastoralist conflict plagues numerous sub-Saharan African countries, where 60% of the world's estimated 50-100 million pastoralists live [@sheik1999health; @omar1992health].  As economic and climactic trends continue to decrease land availability, it's likely that farmer-pastoralist conflict will become an increasingly large problem in the world.

We conduct a field experiment with farmer and pastoralist communities to determine if intergroup contact effectively reduces prejudice between groups in conflict.  We identified fifteen sites where farmer and pastoral groups had engaged in violent conflict within the previous 12 months.  We then randomly assigned ten of fifteen conflict sites to receive a twelve month peacebuilding program based around intergroup contact, with the other five sites serving as the control group.^[Based on the success of ECPN, Mercy Corps received further funding to implement the peacebuilding program in the control sites _after_ the final evaluation of ECPN was completed.  The control sites were not informed that they would receive a peacebulding program during the evaluation.]  The program formed committees with equal numbers of farmers and pastoralists, including community leaders from both groups, to plan and construct two infrastructure projects that would benefit both communities: (1) a borehole to increase access to potable water and (2) a project of their choosing, such as a primary health center, school, or expanded market building.  These committees represented the four conditions that @allport1954prejudice theorized were necessary for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice: the two groups cooperated to achieve joint goals in an equal status context with the support of authorities.

This results of this field experiment demonstrate that intergroup contact can effectively reduce prejudice even in contexts of escalating intergroup violence and even when the groups' economic incentives oppose cooperation.  Communities that received the ECPN program increased their intergroup contact, trust in the outgroup, and perceptions of physical security, compared to the control group that received no program.  We observe the most positive changes from individuals directly involved in the intergroup committees, but effects of intergroup contact diffuse to group members who are not involved in the intergroup contact intervention.  

In this article, we begin by reviewing the literature on intergroup prejudice, focusing on the theory of intergroup contact and highlighting conditions under which contact may be ineffective at reducing prejudice.  We then discuss what farmer-pastoralist conflict can teach us about intergroup contact, describe our experimental intervention and two designs to evaluate the effect of the intervention, and present the results of the study.  We conclude by connecting the implications of these findings to theories of group prejudice.

## My Thoughts

- Better to be able to say a potential mechanism: Results suggest that the contact decreased threat/increased perceptions of benefit from cooperation/something
- Both violence + conflict over resources?  Does that help by making this broad (union) or hurt by making it too narrow (intersection)
- Should I even discuss "RGCT" in this introduction?
- Should I discuss rational choice theories here or at all?  What are some rational choice theories about conflict?
- Should I bring up the fact that we want peacebuilding interventions to affect people who don't directly participate (i.e. diffuse to non-participants)?
- Fast and loose with "reduce conflict vs prejudice"?  Just make it prejudice?
- How to better distinguish the cause of conflict (scarce resources) and the consequences of the conflict (history of violence).

## Abstract

Can intergroup contact reduce group prejudice even when economic incentives are opposed and even amidst an escalating conflict?  Do these effects diffuse to ingroup members with no direct contact?  A voluminous literature on intergroup prejudice fails to answer these questions; some theories suggest yes while other theories suggest no.  Few if any studies test these theories in the context of opposing economic incentives and active violence, yet opposing economic incentives and active violence are the hallmark of many world conflicts where social science theories are put into practice.  We answer these questions by conducting a field experiment with 30 communities in Nigeria, where farmers and pastoralists are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that a yearlong intergroup contact intervention for a small subset of community members reduces prejudice and increases perceptions of physical security, even for community members not directly involved in the intervention.  This experiment demonstrates the efficacy of intergroup contact, even in the context of opposed economic incentives and escalating conflict.

# Scacco Intro
Can grassroots interventions that increase contact
between members of antagonistic groups reduce
prejudice, discrimination, and conflict? In spite
of a vast literature on social contact in psychology and
political science, and an explosion of NGO-led contact
interventions in conflict settings around the world, basic
questions remain about the consequences of intergroup
contact in deeply divided societies. Does cooperative
contact between individuals from across a deep
social cleavage lead to reductions in prejudice and discrimination?
How intensive must social contact be to
induce positive effects? Does contact affect all groups
involved in social interactions equally?

We conducted a field experiment—the Urban Youth
Vocational Training (UYVT) project—to test whether
sustained contact in an educational setting can improve
communal relations in a conflict-prone environment.
The UYVT intervention brought together a random
sample of Christian and Muslim young men from
disadvantaged neighborhoods in Kaduna, Nigeria, a
city that has experienced repeated episodes of severe
communal violence, for sixteen weeks of computer
training. Our experimental design examined whether
intergroup social contact can reduce prejudice and discrimination
in a context of deep animosity. This study
applies field experimental methods to a normatively
important goal, the reduction of violent conflict and the
promotion of post-conflict stability in deeply divided
societies.
To assess the impact of our intervention, we randomized
(1) recruitment into the computer training
program, (2) assignment to a religiously homogeneous
or heterogeneous classroom, and (3) assignment to a
coreligious or non-coreligious learning partner within
the classroom.Wemeasured prejudice through surveybased
assessments of agreement with negative and positive
stereotypes, and measured discrimination through
two behavioral games embedded in our post-treatment
survey:a dictator game and a destruction game.We find
that though prejudice is resistant to change, intergroup
contact can reduce discriminatory behavior: After the
end of the training course, subjects assigned to heterogeneous
classes discriminated significantly less against
out-group members than subjects assigned to homogeneous
classes. This suggests contact can change behavior
even without attendant changes in entrenched
attitudes.
We also present evidence suggesting a striking explanation
for why subjects in mixed classes discriminate
less than subjects in homogeneous classes. Mixed-class
subjects do not actually discriminate much less after
the end of the course than a third group of randomly
assigned non-UYVT study participants. However, subjects
assigned to homogeneous classes discriminate significantly more than these nonparticipants. This
suggests opportunities for in-group bonding can
heighten discrimination, and programs for mixed
groups may be desirable not simply because they expose
participants to out-group individuals, but because
they reduce the time spent with in-group members.
This insight has eluded much of the literature on social
contact interventions, which focuses on comparing
individuals in mixed and nonmixed contact environments
and commonly neglects comparisons to subjects
not exposed to the intervention. Our research design
enables comparison of both contact treatments with
non-UYVT participants.
Studying intergroup contact between young men
in Kaduna, Nigeria advances our broader understanding
of ethnic conflict and peacebuilding in several
ways. First, Nigeria has been a flash-point for
Christian-Muslim conflict since the 1960s. Ethnoreligious
pogroms and reprisal attacks in 1966 killed as
many as 30,000 civilians and displaced over one million
people (McKenna 1969), Christian-Muslim riots
have resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths in riots in
2000, 2002, and 2011, and recent Boko Haram bombings
and reprisals in 2012 and 2014 have killed hundreds.
This history of violence has resulted in high levels
of ongoing tension typical of ethnic conflicts. Second,
religious riots since 2000 have led to extreme
residential segregation in Kaduna and other Nigerian
cities. This pattern of post-conflict spatial segregation
can be found in urban conflict zones around
the globe, including cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
India, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Northern Ireland,
and South Africa. By limiting intergroup contact,
segregation may deepen already prejudiced attitudes
developed over years of localized conflict (Glaeser
2005). Understanding whether grassroots social contact
interventions can alter prejudices and decrease
discriminatory behavior in such contexts is a key
piece in the puzzle of how societies can manage diversity
and recover from large-scale communal conflict.
Estimating the extent to which social contact
has an independent effect on intergroup relations can
help practitioners design more effective peacebuilding
interventions.
This article begins by discussing the potential effects
of intergroup social contact on prejudice reduction
and peacebuilding, and questions the social psychology
literature’s optimistic assessment of the contact
hypothesis. It then reviews relevant features of
the Nigerian context, our experimental design, and the
type of social contact introduced in the UYVT program.
We next present analyses of the effects of our
intervention on intergroup attitudes (prejudice) and
behavior (discrimination).Our data suggest that while
out-group social contact does not affect prejudiced attitudes,
it can meaningfully affect discriminatory behavior.
The robust and significant effects of assignment to
theUYVTintervention—a highly valued computer education
program—demonstrate that overt peace education
components of social contact interventions are
not necessary to induce meaningful behavioral change.
We conclude with implications for the design of social contact interventions and education-centered development
programming in divided societies.
