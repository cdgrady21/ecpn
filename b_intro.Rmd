## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Intro Outline

We want intergroup contact to work in the type of contexts that groups in conflict are in.  We have almost no evidence about the effects of intergroup contact in contexts where economic incentives should push groups apart and between-group violence is frequent.^[ScaccoNote]  Lots of research suggests intergroup contact _can_ reduce group-level prejudice.  It reduces prejudice black-white, Muslim, women, gays, etc [chris: from Pettigrew and Paluck studies mostly].  But few studies use groups in active conflict or in economic competition.  Other perspectives on intergroup prejudice -- realistic group conflict theory and rational choice perspectives of conflict -- would predict no effect from contact.

[^ScaccoNote]: A notable exception is Scacco article in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact.  That study also showed null effects for intergroup contact but negative effects for intragroup contact.  That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and the intervention sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

Contact's effects on racial/ethnic groups are notably weaker than for other groups [Chris: Paluck].  Some studies also show that contact among these group members can increase prejudice [Chris: Ryan Enos, Gubler, negative contact guy].  Can contact overcome conflict and economic factors to reduce prejudice in places most in need of reduced prejudice?

We also want effects of intergroup contact for some ingroup members to diffuse to other ingroup members who have no contact.  The most prejudiced individuals will probably avoid contact, but if effects of contact from other ingroup members diffuse to these very prejudiced individuals -- either through vicarious/imagined contact or through social norm transmission -- intergroup contact could reduce prejudice even for individuals who do not engage in intergroup contact.

Farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria's Middlebelt is an ideal context to learn about the effect of intergroup contact on intergroup attitudes in a conflict environment.  As Nigeria's population expands and arable land recedes, economic imperatives have pushed subsistence farmers and pastoralists into a deadly conflict.  Despite attention paid towards Boko Haram in Nigeria's northeast, the farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria's middlebelt has claimed more lives, accounts for $13 billion lost annually, and has caused hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people's, greatly stressing Nigeria's economic and social infrastructure.  Farmer-pastoralist conflict plagues numerous sub-Saharan African countries, where 60% of the world's estimated 50-100 million pastoralists live [Chris: cite these: Where health care has no access: the nomadic populations of sub-Saharan Africa; Healthcare for Nomads too, please.].  As these economic and climactic trends continue, it's likely that farmer-pastoralist conflict will become an increasingly large problem in the world.

We conduct a field experiment with farmer and pastoralist communities to determine if intergroup contact effectively reduces prejudice in violent contexts where economic incentives drive groups apart.  We identifeid fifteen sites where farming villages and pastoralist groups had engaged in violent conflict within the previous 12 months.  We then randomly assigned ten of fifteen conflict sites to receive a peacebuilding program based around intergroup contact.  The program engaged farmers and pastoralists in cooperation to achieve joint goals in an equal status context with the support of authorities.

This study demonstrates that intergroup contact can effectively reduce prejudice even in contexts of intergroup violence and even when the groups' economic incentives oppose cooperation.  The contact centers on joint goals that materially benefit both communities, which may be key.  Effects of intergroup contact diffuse to group members who are not involved in the intergroup contact intervention.

## Abstract

Can intergroup contact reduce group prejudice even when economic incentives are opposed and even amidst an escalating conflict?  Do these effects diffuse to ingroup members with no direct contact?  A voluminous literature on intergroup prejudice fails to answer these questions; some theories suggest yes while other theories suggest no.  Few if any studies test these theories in the context of opposing economic incentives and active violence, yet opposing economic incentives and active violence are the hallmark of many world conflicts where social science theories are put into practice.  We answer these questions by conducting a field experiment with 30 communities in Nigeria, where farmers and pastoralists are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that a yearlong intergroup contact intervention for a small subset of community members reduces prejudice and increases perceptions of physical security, even for community members not directly involved in the intervention.  This experiment demonstrates the efficacy of intergroup contact, even in the context of opposed economic incentives and escalating conflict.

# Scacco Intro
Can grassroots interventions that increase contact
between members of antagonistic groups reduce
prejudice, discrimination, and conflict? In spite
of a vast literature on social contact in psychology and
political science, and an explosion of NGO-led contact
interventions in conflict settings around the world, basic
questions remain about the consequences of intergroup
contact in deeply divided societies. Does cooperative
contact between individuals from across a deep
social cleavage lead to reductions in prejudice and discrimination?
How intensive must social contact be to
induce positive effects? Does contact affect all groups
involved in social interactions equally?

We conducted a field experiment—the Urban Youth
Vocational Training (UYVT) project—to test whether
sustained contact in an educational setting can improve
communal relations in a conflict-prone environment.
The UYVT intervention brought together a random
sample of Christian and Muslim young men from
disadvantaged neighborhoods in Kaduna, Nigeria, a
city that has experienced repeated episodes of severe
communal violence, for sixteen weeks of computer
training. Our experimental design examined whether
intergroup social contact can reduce prejudice and discrimination
in a context of deep animosity. This study
applies field experimental methods to a normatively
important goal, the reduction of violent conflict and the
promotion of post-conflict stability in deeply divided
societies.
To assess the impact of our intervention, we randomized
(1) recruitment into the computer training
program, (2) assignment to a religiously homogeneous
or heterogeneous classroom, and (3) assignment to a
coreligious or non-coreligious learning partner within
the classroom.Wemeasured prejudice through surveybased
assessments of agreement with negative and positive
stereotypes, and measured discrimination through
two behavioral games embedded in our post-treatment
survey:a dictator game and a destruction game.We find
that though prejudice is resistant to change, intergroup
contact can reduce discriminatory behavior: After the
end of the training course, subjects assigned to heterogeneous
classes discriminated significantly less against
out-group members than subjects assigned to homogeneous
classes. This suggests contact can change behavior
even without attendant changes in entrenched
attitudes.
We also present evidence suggesting a striking explanation
for why subjects in mixed classes discriminate
less than subjects in homogeneous classes. Mixed-class
subjects do not actually discriminate much less after
the end of the course than a third group of randomly
assigned non-UYVT study participants. However, subjects
assigned to homogeneous classes discriminate significantly more than these nonparticipants. This
suggests opportunities for in-group bonding can
heighten discrimination, and programs for mixed
groups may be desirable not simply because they expose
participants to out-group individuals, but because
they reduce the time spent with in-group members.
This insight has eluded much of the literature on social
contact interventions, which focuses on comparing
individuals in mixed and nonmixed contact environments
and commonly neglects comparisons to subjects
not exposed to the intervention. Our research design
enables comparison of both contact treatments with
non-UYVT participants.
Studying intergroup contact between young men
in Kaduna, Nigeria advances our broader understanding
of ethnic conflict and peacebuilding in several
ways. First, Nigeria has been a flash-point for
Christian-Muslim conflict since the 1960s. Ethnoreligious
pogroms and reprisal attacks in 1966 killed as
many as 30,000 civilians and displaced over one million
people (McKenna 1969), Christian-Muslim riots
have resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths in riots in
2000, 2002, and 2011, and recent Boko Haram bombings
and reprisals in 2012 and 2014 have killed hundreds.
This history of violence has resulted in high levels
of ongoing tension typical of ethnic conflicts. Second,
religious riots since 2000 have led to extreme
residential segregation in Kaduna and other Nigerian
cities. This pattern of post-conflict spatial segregation
can be found in urban conflict zones around
the globe, including cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
India, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Northern Ireland,
and South Africa. By limiting intergroup contact,
segregation may deepen already prejudiced attitudes
developed over years of localized conflict (Glaeser
2005). Understanding whether grassroots social contact
interventions can alter prejudices and decrease
discriminatory behavior in such contexts is a key
piece in the puzzle of how societies can manage diversity
and recover from large-scale communal conflict.
Estimating the extent to which social contact
has an independent effect on intergroup relations can
help practitioners design more effective peacebuilding
interventions.
This article begins by discussing the potential effects
of intergroup social contact on prejudice reduction
and peacebuilding, and questions the social psychology
literature’s optimistic assessment of the contact
hypothesis. It then reviews relevant features of
the Nigerian context, our experimental design, and the
type of social contact introduced in the UYVT program.
We next present analyses of the effects of our
intervention on intergroup attitudes (prejudice) and
behavior (discrimination).Our data suggest that while
out-group social contact does not affect prejudiced attitudes,
it can meaningfully affect discriminatory behavior.
The robust and significant effects of assignment to
theUYVTintervention—a highly valued computer education
program—demonstrate that overt peace education
components of social contact interventions are
not necessary to induce meaningful behavioral change.
We conclude with implications for the design of social contact interventions and education-centered development
programming in divided societies.
