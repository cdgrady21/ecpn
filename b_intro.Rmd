# Thinking


**Intro**

Need to explain why I am doing things more than tell people details of what I am doing.  Only provide broad strokes for what I did.

Field experiment papers often take a couple paragraphs talking about the field experiment, but I don't want to.

Big framing points:

- Psych reconciliation can be effective at reducing real world conflict.
- Mechanism seems to be intergroup contact, which increases intergroup trust.  Trust has many positive consequences.

## Introduction

<!--Story about burnt down village/bad outcomes-->
Intergroup conflict is responsible for many of the worst displays of human nature.  In Nigeria, intergroup conflict between farmers and pastoralists has claimed countless lives and destroyed countless communities.  As the conflict escalated, groups of anti-pastoralist vigilantes mobilized to pre-emptively prevent pastoralists from encroaching on land claimed by farmers [@duru2018court].  These groups, dubbed the "livestock guard", often ransacked pastoralist settlements and violently drove pastoralists from their homes.  Likewise, pastoralist groups often enacted vigilante justice, raiding and burning down farming villages seen to encroach on land claimed by pastoralists.  Raids such as these forced up to 180,000 people from their homes in 2018 [@daniel2018anti] <!-- In both cases, neighbors often assisted as the other group was forced to flee their homes-->

<!--Story about village defending pastoralists-->

<!--Though farmer-pastoralist conflict was widespread, not all areas faced such dire consequences.--> Yet in one village, farmers and pastoralists defended each other.  When a group of livestock guard came for one pastoralist settlement, the neighboring farming village arrested them to protect the pastoralists.  After the arrest, farmers and pastoralists convened to decide what should be done with the prisoners.  They agreed that the group of livestock guard should not be punished, but should be disarmed and released home -- a proposition proposed by _the pastoralists_.  

These farmers and pastoralists had also struggled with conflict, and people on both sides had died in disputes over farmland and grazing land.  But their disputes had not escalated to the point that each side wanted the other removed by any means necessary.  They had created structures that allowed them to settle disputes, and the same structures allowed them to reach a solution about the livestock guard.

<!--What accounts for the difference?-->

Why were some farmer and pastoralist groups able to keep peace whereas others were swallowed by the escalating conflict?  Why did farmers assist the livestock guard in some areas but obstruct them in others?  Why were some communities able to overcome their intergroup disputes whereas others were destroyed by them?  Understanding how groups resolve their own disputes is important for mitigating and preventing the myriad intergroup conflicts around the world.  

<!--To prevent this type of intergroup conflict, international community or strong state actors usually intervenes.  Those type of interventions not always successful, not always possible for that type of intervention.-->

Many intergrup conflicts are not resolved by the groups themselves.  Outside actors often intervene to prevent violence, keep the peace, and mediate disputes.  Peacekeepers have been deployed in numerous countnries, including Croatia and Bosnia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, and India and Pakistan.  

Mediation efforts 

But these interventions are not always possible and not always successful.  Successful peacekeeping vs unsuccessful peacekeeping research.  Successful peacekeeping requires large comittment of forces, requires money, requires Y.  Peacekeeping does not work when X, Y.  [Peacekeeping failed in X] Peacekeeping often does not stop violence between the conflicting groups -- Somalia [@autesserre2019crisis].  Peacekeepers can serve as a check on violence while disputes are hashed out, but don't resolve the underlying conflict .  Peacekeeping has been criticized for not solving the underlying problems that cause conflict [@autesserre2019crisis].  Within 10 years of UN intervention, 75% of civil wars resumed [@weinstein2005autonomous]

In the farmer-pastoralist case, no such intervention was present.  Far from being an unbiased mediator, the state intervened _on behalf of farmers_.

<!--A different approach is grassroots psychological reconciliation based on intergroup contact.  Groups in conflict often hold strong negative attitudes that make peace difficult.  Psych reconciliation can improve intergroup attitudes.  Improving intergroup attitudes can help reduce conflict.-->

While most attempts to reduce violent conflict between groups is top-down, Autessere 2019 Foreign Affairs called for more "bottom-up strategies that [let] the people themselves determine how best to promote peace."[@autesserre2019crisis].  One barrier to bottom-up strategies are that groups in conflict often hold strong negative attitudes that make peace difficult.


<!--Say what we did in context of farmer-pastoralist conflict.  Some context, some intervention design, some evaluation.-->

<!--Say what we found.  It seems primarily through intergroup contact.  -->

<!--Say implications for: (1) conflict resolution, especially intergroup and intercommunal violence.  On the rise, Fulani being massacred in Mali (Economist March 30, 2019).-->

<!--(2) intergroup contact theory, -->

<!--(3) social institutions constraining behavior, intergroup bargaining -->

<!--(4) peacebuilding programs and CDD, -->

<!--(5) spillover of effects and social norms/vicarious learning.-->

<!--Future work should further investigate mechanisms through which grassroots strategies can be successful.  Conditions under which different conflict resolution strategies are successful -- when outside actors needed, when groups can be assisted in solving own conflict.-->

<!--Roadmap.-->
