# Thinking


**Intro**

Need to explain why I am doing things more than tell people details of what I am doing.  Only provide broad strokes for what I did.

Field experiment papers often take a couple paragraphs talking about the field experiment, but I don't want to.

Big framing points:

- Psych reconciliation can be effective at reducing real world conflict.
- Mechanism seems to be intergroup contact, which increases intergroup trust.  Trust has many positive consequences.

## Introduction

<!--Story about burnt down village/bad outcomes-->
Intergroup conflict is responsible for many of the worst displays of human nature.  In Nigeria, intergroup conflict between farmers and pastoralists has claimed countless lives and destroyed countless communities over the past two decades.  As the conflict escalated, groups of anti-pastoralist vigilantes mobilized to pre-emptively prevent pastoralists from encroaching on land claimed by farmers [@duru2018court; @mcdonnel2017graze].  These groups, dubbed the "livestock guard", often ransacked pastoralist settlements and violently drove pastoralists from their homes.  Likewise, pastoralist groups often enacted vigilante justice, raiding and burning down farming villages seen to encroach on land claimed by pastoralists.  Raids such as these forced up to 180,000 people from their homes in 2018 [@daniel2018anti] and farmer-pastoralist conflict costs Nigeria $13 billion of lost economic productivity annually [@mcdougal2015effect] <!-- In both cases, neighbors often assisted as the other group was forced to flee their homes-->

<!--Story about village defending pastoralists. chris: write first few sentences better.-->

Though farmer-pastoralist conflict was widespread, mass violence did not break out in all communities with farmer-pastoralist conflict.  In one village, farmers and pastoralists defended each other from hostile neighbors.  When a group of livestock guard came for one pastoralist settlement, the neighboring farming village arrested them to protect the pastoralists.  After the arrest, farmers and pastoralists convened to decide what should be done with the prisoners.  They agreed that the group of livestock guard should not be punished, but should be disarmed and released home -- a proposition proposed by _the pastoralists_.  These farmers and pastoralists had also struggled with conflict, and people on both sides had died in disputes over farmland and grazing land.  But their disputes had not escalated to the point that each side wanted the other removed by any means necessary.  They had created structures that allowed them to settle disputes, and the same structures allowed them to reach a solution about the livestock guard.

<!--What accounts for the difference?-->

Why were some farmer and pastoralist groups able to keep peace whereas others were swallowed by the escalating conflict?  Why were some communities able to overcome their intergroup disputes whereas others were destroyed by them?  <!--signposting psych literature: intergroup contact, social spillover, superordinate goals.-->  We argue that intergroup prejudice, which both fuels and is fueled by intergroup conflict, 

We argue that communities were able to avoid being engulfed in the wave of violence if they reduced the intergroup prejudice that both fuels and is fuled by intergroup conflict.  Specifically, intergroup trust helps groups overcome intergroup conflict.  We argue that psychological reconciliation based on intergroup contact and superordinate goals can help groups increase intergroup trust and mitigate conflict.  Understanding how groups resolve their disputes is important for mitigating and preventing the myriad intergroup conflicts around the world.

<!--To prevent this type of intergroup conflict, international community or strong state actors usually intervenes.  Those type of interventions not always successful, not always possible to use that type of intervention.-->

Most literature and policy about peacebuilding and preventing intergroup conflict revolves around international intervention into the conflict [@autesserre2017international; @smith2003mediation; cite more].  Intervention from outside the conflict helps the conflicting actors overcome bargaining failures that lead to conflict [@fearon1994ethnic; @fearon1995rationalist; @powell2006war; @smith2003mediation].  Outside actors like the UN frequently intervene to prevent violence and mediate disputes, as they did in Croatia and Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, and India and Pakistan.  Ideally, peacekeepers protect bystanders and prevent more violent conflict while mediation assists the two groups in settling disputes peacefully.  In the aggregate, research shows that peacekeeping and mediation are effective strategies to promote peace in many conflicts [@doyle2000international; cite more].

While international intervention has been successful in many contexts and conditions, several intergroup conflicts seem outside of these conditions.  International intervention is often unsuccessful -- @weinstein2005autonomous estimated that 75% of civil wars resume within 10 years of UN intervention.  Notably, international intervention failed to stop intergroup conflicts in DRC [@autesserre2010trouble], Somalia [@autesserre2019crisis], and Rwanda [@dallaire2009shake].  One reason for these failures is that international intervention is often more influenced by international norms about what strategies _should_ work than finding the strategies that are most likely to work in a given context [@paris2003peacekeeping].  But international intervention has also been criticized for not solving the underlying problems that cause conflict -- a band-aid when the conflict needs a doctor [@autesserre2019crisis].

Even for contexts when international intervention would be successful, it is not always feasible or timely.  Before intervention can occur, the international community must agree on an appropriate intervention and make large comittments of forces and financing.  As a result, international intervention often comes late and costs billions of dollars.  Even if international intervention would successfully mediate many conflicts, intervention maybe too late and is unlikely to be applied unless preventing the conflict is an international priority.  International intervention is not used in "no peace -- no war" contexts.

<!--A different approach is grassroots psychological reconciliation based on intergroup contact.  Groups in conflict often hold strong negative attitudes that make peace difficult.  Psych reconciliation can improve intergroup attitudes.  Improving intergroup attitudes can help reduce conflict.

chris: need to add more than just contact theory stuff because ECPN has more.  And other lit (@ditlmann2017addressing) talks about programs using a variety of approaches.-->

While most attempts to reduce violent conflict between groups are top-down, scholars and practicioners have called for more consideration of bottom-up strategies [@autesserre2017international; @ditlmann2017addressing; @safunu2012grassroots; @autesserre2016failure].  Botom-up strategies focus on engaging local actors and assisting them in reducing group conflict.  Conflicts at local levels are often driven and perpetuated by intergroup animosity long after the original grievance is forgotten [@mcdonnel2017graze; cite more about intergroup animosity].  The intergroup animosity and strongly negative attitudes can be an insurmountable barrier to peace.  Individuals often motivatedly reason to rationalize their beliefs, which leads to biased processing of information about outgroup members' behavior -- behavior by outgroup members may be perceived as more threatening and more malicious than the same behavior comitted by a neutral party [cite fundamental attribution error, motivated reasoning; @hewstone1990ultimate].  The perceived negative behavior may be seen as _defining_ of the group, whereas any perceived positive behavior may be seen as the _exception_ to the group [@allison1985group; @pettigrew1979ultimate].  This biased information processing reinforces negative group stereotypes and can subvert the groups' own attempts to foster peace.  It can also sabotage intergroup bargaining by causing the groups to have incorrect beliefs about each other, adding to information and comittment problems that cause conflict.  Bottom-up strategies that help reduce group prejudice could help the groups achieve peace without the large-scale international intervention efforts most commonly used to build peace.

One of the most promising approaches to reducing intergroup prejudice and violence comes from intergroup contact theory.  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will reduce prejudice and the likelihood of violence.  Intergroup contact works by demystifying the outgroup, presenting the other group's perspective, and replacing imagined stereotypes with firsthand knowledge [@pettigrew2008does].  <!--chris: next sentence on chopping block.-->  The prejudice-reducing effects of intergroup contact have been demonstrated in a variety of countries and using a variety of methodological approaches [@paluck2017contact; @pettigrew2006meta].  Notably, intergroup contacted programs reduced prejudice between whites and blacks in the U.S. and South Africa [@marmaros2006friendships; @burns2015interaction], Jews and Arabs [@yablon2012we; @ditlmann2016can], Muslims and Christians [@Scacco2016], and Hindus and Muslims [@barnhardt2009near].  Peacebuilding programs utilizing intergroup contact and other activities are increasing used to reduce intergroup conflict by peacebuilding organizations [@ditlmann2017addressing].

Although research shows support for intergroup contact theory generally, its efficacy to reduce prejudice amid _real-world_ conflict is an open question.  First, most research about intergroup contact uses correlational studies or lab experiments, both of which have methodological weaknesses.  Correlational studies cannot demonstrate causal effects, and results from lab experiments may not apply to real world conflicts, where groups compete for resources and share a history of intergroup violence [@ditlmann2017addressing].  Second, no prior studies of intergroup contact have involved groups engaged in active intergroup violence^[Previous studies have involved groups with a history of violence conflict -- see @Scacco2016 and @ditlmann2016can.], and some studies suggest that intergroup contact in violent settings will be ineffective or even backfire [@paolini2010negative; @gubler2013humanizing].  Negative experiences with outgroups increase prejudice, and the most prejudiced individuals are most likely to interpret intergroup contact negatively.  Despite a lack of evidence about the effects of bottom-up peacebuilding programs in violent contexts, and the risks of programs going badly, peacebuilding organizations implement numerous bottom-up interventions in violent contexts each year.  Though well-intentioned, these programs may do more harm than good.

<!--Say what we did in context of farmer-pastoralist conflict.  Some context, some intervention design (contact, mediation), some evaluation.-->

To study the effect of grassroots interventions on violent conflict, we conduct a field experiment with farmer and pastoralist communities Nigeria to determine if an intergroup contact-based program effectively reduces prejudice and violent conflict.  We randomly assigned communities with farmer-pastoralist violence to receive the peacebuilding intervention or serve as a control group.  The intervention formed mixed-group committees and provided them with funds to build infrastructure that would benefit both communities; committees then collaboratively chose and constructed infrastructure projects.^[The communities built boreholes, market stalls, primary health care facilities, etc.]  The program also provided mediation training to each community's leaders.  To measure the effects of the intervention, we conducted pre- and post-intervention surveys, a post-intervention natural public goods behavioral game,[^PGG] and twelve months of systematic observations in markets and social events during the intervention.

[^PGG]: In a public goods game (PGG), research subjects are given money and told they can keep the money or donate it to a public fund.  Money donated to the public fund is multiplied by some amount and then shared with all subjects.  My PGG is _natural_ because it was conducted in a natural setting, rather than a lab.  The funding for the PGG came from the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1656871.

<!--Say what we found.  It seems primarily through intergroup contact.  -->

We find that the program assisted the groups in reducing their conflict.  Compared to the control group, the treatment group increased intergroup contact, trust between the groups, and physical security of the group members.  We find no evidence that the program reduced outgroup threat or caused the groups to expand their conception of "ingroup" to include the other side, two prominent mechanisms for how intergroup contact reduces prejudice.  The results also suggests that intergroup contact for a relatively small percentage of a group can affect attitudes of group members with no exogenous increase in contact with the outgroup.  At the individual-level, we observe the most positive changes from individuals directly involved in the intergroup committees, but we also observe positive changes in the intergroup trust and physical security of group members who were not involved in the intergroup contact intervention.

<!--Say implications for: (1) conflict resolution, especially intergroup and intercommunal violence.  On the rise, Fulani being massacred in Mali (Economist March 30, 2019).  <!--(4) peacebuilding programs and CDD, -->-->

This study expands our knowledge about intergroup conflict in several ways.  First, to our knowledge this is the first field experimental test of a grassroots peacebuilding program implemented by a peacebuilding organization during an active conflict.  We evaluated the program's effects on both attitudinal and behavioral outcomes.  The results suggest that grassroots peacebuilding programs can effectively reduce conflict and is especially relevant to conflict resolution in the cases of intergroup and intercommunal conflicts.

<!--(2) intergroup contact theory, -->

Second, this study is one of the only field experimental interventions to test intergroup contact theory with groups actively engaged in violence.  Each of the groups in our study were part of an active and escalating conflict, with members of each side being killed within one year of the intervention's onset.  Even in such a context, community members who engaged in direct interpersonal interaction with an outgroup member changed more positively than other community members.

<!--(5) spillover of effects and social norms/vicarious learning.  <!--(3) social institutions constraining behavior, intergroup bargaining -->-->

Third, we contribute to the literature about the role of social norms and social institutions in shaping attitudes and behaviors.  Bottom-up peacebuilding interentions seek to provide a structure in which groups can solve their own conflicts, and those structures are social rather than coercive.  Understanding how those structures form and are maintained is relevant to other institutional setups attempting to influence behavior.  In this study, though the greatest changes in attitudes and behaviors were from individuals directly interacting with outgroup members, the attitudes of other community members also improved.  This type of "social effcet" is also a potential way to "scale up" the effects of intergroup contact.

<!--Roadmap.-->

In the next section we provide a theoretical framework for how and why grassroots interventions, especially those based on intergroup contact, can reduce intergroup violence.  We then discuss Nigeria's farmer-pastoralist conflict, our experimental intervention, and two designs to evaluate the effect of the intervention.  Last we present the results of the study and conclude by connecting these findings to theories of group conflict and prejudice.

## Old

In the farmer-pastoralist case, no such intervention was present or likely.  The conflict is rural and unknown to most of the international community.     Far from being an unbiased mediator, the state intervened _on behalf of farmers_.

Chris: cut, have integrate this.
Successful peacekeeping vs unsuccessful peacekeeping research.  Successful peacekeeping requires large comittment of forces, requires money, requires Y.  Peacekeeping does not work when X, Y.  [Peacekeeping failed in X] Peace, keeping often does not stop violence between the conflicting groups -- Somalia [@autesserre2019crisis].  Peacekeepers can serve as a check on violence while disputes are hashed out, but don't resolve the underlying conflict .  Peacekeeping has been criticized for not solving the underlying problems that cause conflict [@autesserre2019crisis].  Within 10 years of UN intervention, 75% of civil wars resumed [@weinstein2005autonomous]

Psychological reconciliation works to improve intergroup attitudes, which can help reduce conflict.  This means looking towards psychological theories about prejudice reduction.

An alternative to international intervention is grassroots psychological reconciliation at the local level.  
  Group reconciliation [@bar2000intractable; @maoz2011protracted].

## Quotes From Articles

"The problem is bigger than mandates and resources. Above all, it has to do with two strategic choices the UN frequently makes: first, to work with national elites to stop violence from the top down and, second, to push for quick elections as a way to consolidate the peace. The standard UN approach to ending wars is to host large, costly conferences in order to strike agreements between governments and rebel leaders and then organize a national vote and declare victory. Both tendencies are based on faulty assumptions."

The weakness of the top-down approach is that warfare is often the result of not just national or international competition but local competition, too. In many conflict zones, the fight is over such issues as land, water, livestock, and low-level traditional and administrative power.

Consider the island of Idjwi, in Lake Kivu in eastern Congo. Since war broke out in Congo in 1996, a conflict that has killed anywhere from two million to five million people, Idjwi has avoided the brunt of the violence, even as other islands in nearby lakes have not. Idjwi has all the same factors that have fueled fighting around it: a geostrategic location, mineral resources, ethnic tensions, a lack of state authority, extreme poverty, disputes over land and traditional power. But the island’s residents, including the poorest and least powerful, have set up various grass-roots organizations—religious networks, women’s associations, youth groups, and so on—to help resolve disputes. They also draw on strong traditional beliefs—for example, forming blood pacts through which different families promise never to hurt one another. They have worked to foster what they call a “culture of peace.”

The UN currently views such bottom-up peace-building efforts as a sideshow. Instead, it should see them as an essential complement to its current top-down efforts to stop fighting.

"bottom-up strategies that [let] the people themselves determine how best to promote peace."
