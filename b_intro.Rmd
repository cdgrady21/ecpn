## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Intro Outline

We want intergroup contact to work in the type of contexts that groups in conflict are in.  We have almost no evidence about the effects of intergroup contact in contexts where economic incentives should push groups apart and between-group violence is frequent.^[ScaccoNote]

[^ScaccoNote]: A notable exception is Scacco article in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact. That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

## Abstract

Can intergroup contact reduce group prejudice even when economic incentives are opposed and even amidst an escalating conflict?  Do these effects diffuse to ingroup members with no direct contact?  A voluminous literature on intergroup prejudice fails to answer these questions; some theories suggest yes while other theories suggest no.  Few if any studies test these theories in the context of opposing economic incentives and active violence, yet opposing economic incentives and active violence are the hallmark of many world conflicts where social science theories are put into practice.  We answer these questions by conducting a field experiment with 30 communities in Nigeria, where farmers and pastoralists are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that a yearlong intergroup contact intervention for a small subset of community members reduces prejudice and increases perceptions of physical security, even for community members not directly involved in the intervention.  This experiment demonstrates the efficacy of intergroup contact, even in the context of opposed economic incentives and escalating conflict.

# Scacco Intro
Can grassroots interventions that increase contact
between members of antagonistic groups reduce
prejudice, discrimination, and conflict? In spite
of a vast literature on social contact in psychology and
political science, and an explosion of NGO-led contact
interventions in conflict settings around the world, basic
questions remain about the consequences of intergroup
contact in deeply divided societies. Does cooperative
contact between individuals from across a deep
social cleavage lead to reductions in prejudice and discrimination?
How intensive must social contact be to
induce positive effects? Does contact affect all groups
involved in social interactions equally?

We conducted a field experiment—the Urban Youth
Vocational Training (UYVT) project—to test whether
sustained contact in an educational setting can improve
communal relations in a conflict-prone environment.
The UYVT intervention brought together a random
sample of Christian and Muslim young men from
disadvantaged neighborhoods in Kaduna, Nigeria, a
city that has experienced repeated episodes of severe
communal violence, for sixteen weeks of computer
training. Our experimental design examined whether
intergroup social contact can reduce prejudice and discrimination
in a context of deep animosity. This study
applies field experimental methods to a normatively
important goal, the reduction of violent conflict and the
promotion of post-conflict stability in deeply divided
societies.
To assess the impact of our intervention, we randomized
(1) recruitment into the computer training
program, (2) assignment to a religiously homogeneous
or heterogeneous classroom, and (3) assignment to a
coreligious or non-coreligious learning partner within
the classroom.Wemeasured prejudice through surveybased
assessments of agreement with negative and positive
stereotypes, and measured discrimination through
two behavioral games embedded in our post-treatment
survey:a dictator game and a destruction game.We find
that though prejudice is resistant to change, intergroup
contact can reduce discriminatory behavior: After the
end of the training course, subjects assigned to heterogeneous
classes discriminated significantly less against
out-group members than subjects assigned to homogeneous
classes. This suggests contact can change behavior
even without attendant changes in entrenched
attitudes.
We also present evidence suggesting a striking explanation
for why subjects in mixed classes discriminate
less than subjects in homogeneous classes. Mixed-class
subjects do not actually discriminate much less after
the end of the course than a third group of randomly
assigned non-UYVT study participants. However, subjects
assigned to homogeneous classes discriminate significantly more than these nonparticipants. This
suggests opportunities for in-group bonding can
heighten discrimination, and programs for mixed
groups may be desirable not simply because they expose
participants to out-group individuals, but because
they reduce the time spent with in-group members.
This insight has eluded much of the literature on social
contact interventions, which focuses on comparing
individuals in mixed and nonmixed contact environments
and commonly neglects comparisons to subjects
not exposed to the intervention. Our research design
enables comparison of both contact treatments with
non-UYVT participants.
Studying intergroup contact between young men
in Kaduna, Nigeria advances our broader understanding
of ethnic conflict and peacebuilding in several
ways. First, Nigeria has been a flash-point for
Christian-Muslim conflict since the 1960s. Ethnoreligious
pogroms and reprisal attacks in 1966 killed as
many as 30,000 civilians and displaced over one million
people (McKenna 1969), Christian-Muslim riots
have resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths in riots in
2000, 2002, and 2011, and recent Boko Haram bombings
and reprisals in 2012 and 2014 have killed hundreds.
This history of violence has resulted in high levels
of ongoing tension typical of ethnic conflicts. Second,
religious riots since 2000 have led to extreme
residential segregation in Kaduna and other Nigerian
cities. This pattern of post-conflict spatial segregation
can be found in urban conflict zones around
the globe, including cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
India, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Northern Ireland,
and South Africa. By limiting intergroup contact,
segregation may deepen already prejudiced attitudes
developed over years of localized conflict (Glaeser
2005). Understanding whether grassroots social contact
interventions can alter prejudices and decrease
discriminatory behavior in such contexts is a key
piece in the puzzle of how societies can manage diversity
and recover from large-scale communal conflict.
Estimating the extent to which social contact
has an independent effect on intergroup relations can
help practitioners design more effective peacebuilding
interventions.
This article begins by discussing the potential effects
of intergroup social contact on prejudice reduction
and peacebuilding, and questions the social psychology
literature’s optimistic assessment of the contact
hypothesis. It then reviews relevant features of
the Nigerian context, our experimental design, and the
type of social contact introduced in the UYVT program.
We next present analyses of the effects of our
intervention on intergroup attitudes (prejudice) and
behavior (discrimination).Our data suggest that while
out-group social contact does not affect prejudiced attitudes,
it can meaningfully affect discriminatory behavior.
The robust and significant effects of assignment to
theUYVTintervention—a highly valued computer education
program—demonstrate that overt peace education
components of social contact interventions are
not necessary to induce meaningful behavioral change.
We conclude with implications for the design of social contact interventions and education-centered development
programming in divided societies.
