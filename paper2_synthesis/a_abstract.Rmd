Thinking about trust needed to overcome commitment problem.  But what does each group need to trust?

What each group must trust is that the other side will punish its own people if they break the agreement.  Before the between-group intergroup bargaining problem can be solved, pastoralists have to believe that farmers will keep each other in line and vice versa.  Otherwise bargaining is still sabotaged by a commitment problem.  

If this is right, then a key take-away for contact theory people is that contact must to provide opportunities for each side to sanction their own group.  Ingroup sanctioning is a costly signal, whereas everything else might be construed as cheap talk.  Group A needs to believe that Group B has solved the within-group collective action problem.

Ingroup sanctioning is a costly signal, whereas everything else might be construed as cheap talk.  Group A needs to believe that Group B has solved the within-group collective action problem.

Consistent with Allport about information that shows other group is similar to my group: I might think my group will sanction me for defecting, but the other group will not.  Information (seeing the other group punish its own) shows me that the other group is like my group.


Two levels of problem:

Level 1: bargaining between farmers and pastoralists.  Level 2: collective action problem of individual farmers/pastoralists abiding by agreements despite individual-level incentives to defect.

Look at the conflict from a “rationalist” and a “psychological” perspective and try to show how each perspective benefits from the intuitions and models of the other.  In that one I start by thinking about the conflict as a bargaining situation where commitments problems are the primary barrier to peace (a la Fearon or Powell) and perhaps the perceived lack of a bargaining range.  I then consider how psychological/social factors affect bargaining by (1) biasing perceptions of the other group’s behavior in a way that prevents each side from receiving costly signals or accurate beliefs about the other group and (2) adding to the utility of fighting and subtracting from the utility of cooperating.  Then I propose cooperative contact as a means to overcome those issues and try to describe how contact builds trust and reduces utility of fighting relative to cooperating.  It’s not a formal theory paper (I am not qualified to write a formal theory paper), but I try to use the ideas and models that come out of formal theory in a paper meant for a poli psych audience.

The thing that’s been missing from the paper I just described is a discussion of and solution to the collective action problem within farmer and pastoralist groups.  As you said, both groups’ knowledge that a pareto-optimal solution exists does not guarantee the pareto-optimal solution is reached.  In this case, I think a key factor is that these groups are heterogeneous.  What each group must trust is that the other side will punish its own people if they break the agreement.  Before the group-level intergroup bargaining problem can be solved, pastoralists have to believe that farmers will keep each other in line and vice versa.  Otherwise bargaining is still sabotaged by a commitment problem.

<!--Groups, in theory, should bargain to avoid violent conflict.  But we see many groups in conflict.  Why?  Psych phenomena cause information and commitment problems that prevent bargaining.  Psych phenomena change payoffs,  bias perceptions of outgroup.

Groups fight because they don't like each other.
When groups don't like each other, they suffer bargaining failures.
Making groups like each other reduces the likelihood of bargaining failures.
Less bargaining failures == more likely to get peace.
Intergroup contact can make groups like each other.

VS

groups competing for resources will hate each other, no matter what.
Competition for resources generates the negative intergroup attitudes.
Therefore competition for resources will always cause conflict.
Intergrop contact will do nothing because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.-->

<!--
Pitch:
How can intergroup contact reduce conflict?  Conflict caused by a variety of factors economic, psychological, political, and historical [Green and Seher 2003; Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013].  Contact usually concerned with prejudice, but need to move beyond prejudice to think about how intergroup contact can resolve and prevent violent conflict [Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013].  Many conflict scholars characterize intergroup conflict as an instance of intergroup bargaining.  I consider how intergroup contact affects that bargaining game.   -->

<!-- 
Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013: "Trust can be seen as a psychological means to overcome uncertainty by making benign assumptions about
other people’s behavior (Kollock, 1994), and it can be very broadly defined as a positive bias in the processing of imperfect information (Yamagishi & Yamagishi, 1994)."

# Abstract

Two separate field of study are concerned with violence between groups: international relations and psychology.


Scholars of International Relations and Psychology are both concerned about violent group conflict, but approach the problem in different ways.  IR scholars approach group conflict as a commitment problem/bargaining failure, where the main barrier to peace is a lack of trust.  Psychology scholars see group conflict as a consequence of group identity, where the main barriers to peace are negative affect and biased perceptions.  Combining these perspectives, we see group conflict as a bargaining failure where affective costs of peace and benefits of fighting limit the "bargaining range" (outcomes each side prefers to fighting) and trust is not built due to perceptual biases.  Interventions that reduce the affective costs of peace and reduce perceptual biases should allow groups to reach peaceful agreements.  We analyze an intergroup contact field experiment in Nigeria, where farmer and pastoralist communities are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  The results suggest that reducing psychological barriers to bargaining between conflicting groups can help the groups build trust.


<!--
IR Perspective on conflict and cooperation.
  - bargaining; commitment problem; trust

Psych Perspective on conflict and cooperation: has looked at many factors that contribute to conflict.
  - competition as inevitable consequence of groups (social ID theory, minimal group paradigm)
  - realistic group conflict theory: inevitable as groups fight over resources
  - contact theory: prejudice caused by stereotypes/information (original), anxiety (newer), lack of empathy (newer), perceived threat (newer).  Prejudice could cause conflict.  Need cooperative contact with superordinate goals
  - 


Why psych needs IR
  - IR/Formal Models show us the relevant characteristics of the situation.
  - Key is trust.  Intervention needs to build trust.
  - Other factors, such as affect, empathy, or social distance are important only insofar as they influence trust.
  - ALSO: must have a bargaining range == outcomes each side prefers to fighting.

Why IR needs psych
  - Psych knows a lot about psychological basis for trust.  Things that affect building trust: biased perceptions of behavior.
  - ALSO: non-material costs and benefits that change the bargaining range.

# Thinking

Big framing points:

- Contact theory can be effective at reducing real world conflict.
- Contact increases intergroup trust, which allows groups to bargain even in the absence of external costs of breaking agreements.
-->
<!--
- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed and amidst escalating conflict.
- Intergroup contact helps increase trust and help groups overcome bargaining/comittment problems
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Title

get the big picture stuff about "peace amidst conflict", get the IR conflict people with the word conflict, get the psych people with the word "intergroup contact", get experimental methods people with "field experiment", get Africanists with "Nigeria".

## Pitch 

- Institutions constrain behavior.
- IR conflict and reducing intergroup conflict with a strong 3rd party.  3rd party (institutions, police, powerful state) holds groups to bargaining agreements, so each group can trust the other.
  - but we cannot police everything, costly. And rural areas are often beyond state control.  Need something that functions like police but doesn't require a 3rd party walking around and punishing everyone.
- Intergroup trust can function as an institution that allows bargaining because the each group _trusts_ that the other will fulfill their end of the agreement.
  - Contracts & law are ways we can trust people without knowing them.  Large costs to defecting on our agreements help everyone trust that agreements will be kept.
  - But small groups do not necessarily need legal contracts and formal laws.  Ellen Ostrom.
- Intergroup contact can increase intergroup trust (not generalized trust, specific intergroup trust).
  - maybe by giving the opportunity for costly signals of trust.  Like ingroup policing.
- Intergroup contact could also reduce conflict by reducing perceptions of threat or expanding "ingroup" to include the other group.
    - No evidence that the intergroup contact program reduced threat perceptions.
    - Very limited evidence that intergroup cohesion increased; does not look like the two groups started to think of eachother as "ingroup"
- My mechanism: intergroup contact works to reduce intergroup violence and prejudice by creating intergroup trust.  Intergroup trust functions as a social institution that allows bargaining.  Groups can bargain because they trust that the other group's behavior is constrained.

- **Issues**:I don't have an actual measure of violent conflict.  I do not measure things directly related to bargaining process/comittment problem and can only theoretically discuss how intergroup contact relates to comittment problem.


# Old

But want to keep this old stuff.

## Pitch 1

- Testing intergroup contact in a violent environment.  Intergroup contact often used in violent places, but not tested in contexts of violence.  Reasons to believe violent contexts would reduce effect of contact.  Have this context where groups are violent and doing intergroup contact intervention between them.  Psych theories would expect it to work, but some psych evidence and rationalist theories of violent conflict would not.  Results show that the program is effective -- intervention increased contact, trust, and perceptions of safety/security.  These results suggest that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice and conflict, even in violent contexts.

- **Major Issue**: Rather unexciting theoretically.  Just another citation in a contact theory meta-analysis.  Too similar to Scacco & Warren 2018.  Brands me as rather atheoretical field experimenter type.  But is super clear.


## Pitch 2

- Bridging rationalist theories with psychological theories. Rationalist theories of intergroup violence say intergroup violence is a comittment problem -- groups need something that allows them to credibly commit to a bargaining agreement, and can do that through a strong neutral third party.  Psychological theories say intergroup violence is an emotional/attitudinal problem -- can solve by reducing prejudice/dehumanization and increasing trust, which can be done through intergroup contact.  Have this context where groups are violent and am doing intergroup contact intervention between them.  Rationalist theories would predict this intervention would not affect the conflict or prejudice because does not change strategic situation or enforce bargaining agreements.  Psychological theories would predict this intervention would reduce conflict and prejudice by redefining the outgroup, reducing threat perceptions, and increasing empathy towards the outgroup.  Results show that program is effective -- intervention increased contact, trust, and perceptions of safety/security.  These results suggest that intergroup contact can promote peace between groups in conflict.  Intergroup contact can help solve the commitment problem of intergroup conflict by increasing trust that the other group will abide by its agreements and increasing the psychological costs of conflict (reducing dehumanization of outgroup -- i used to get satisfaction out of killing your group and now I feel very bad about it).  Bridging psychological and rationalist theories can help us more effectively bring peace to violent contexts.

- **Issues**: This isn't quite what I want to say.  I want to connect things more to "institutions constrain behavior" not just "Rationalism/IR says need institutions to restrain conflict."  Also, I don't have an actual measure of violent conflict.  I do not measure things directly related to bargaining process/comittment problem and can only theoretically discuss how intergroup contact relates to comittment problem.  Is slightly more work?

### Pitch 2 Abstract

Can intergroup contact contribute to peace between groups involved in violent conflict?  Do these effects diffuse to ingroup members with no direct intergroup contact?  A psychological explanation for conflict says intergroup violence is an emotional/attitudinal problem that can be ameliorated by intergroup contact that increases trust between groups.  But a common rationalist explanation for conflict says intergroup violence is a commitment problem that can only be ameliorated by outside factors that hold the conflicting groups to their commitments.  This rationalist explanation would predict that intergroup contact will not affect intergroup conflict or trust because it does not change either group's strategic incentives or enforce bargaining agreements.  However, we reformulate the committment problem as a trust problem and hypothesize that increasing intergroup trust can help solve comittment problems.  We test the ability of intergroup contact to promote peace between violently conflicting groups with a field experiment in Nigeria, where farmer and pastoralist communities are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that the program increases intergroup trust and perceptions of physical security, even for community members not directly involved in the intervention.  These results suggest that intergroup contact can promote peace between groups in conflict by increasing trust that the other group will abide by its agreements.  Bridging psychological and rationalist theories can help us more effectively bring peace to violent contexts.

## Abstract 3

Intergroup conflict is responsible for many of the worst displays of human nature.  In this paper we test the ability of intergroup contact to contribute to peace between groups involved in violent conflict.  Intergroup conflict is often characterized as a bargaining failure.  Both groups would benefit from compromise, but negotiations break down and conflict ensues because neither group trusts the other to abide by their agreements.  The proposed solutions are coercive institutions that prevent groups from defecting on bargained agreements.  However, coercive power cannot reach many group conflicts.  We propose intergroup contact as an alternative to coercive institutions.  Coercive institutions substitute for intergroup trust, but intergroup contact can foster intergroup trust directly by creating situations in which groups can signal their trustworthiness.  Intergroup trust allows groups to bargain even in the absence of coercive institutions.  We test the ability of intergroup contact to promote peace between violently conflicting groups with a field experiment in Nigeria, where farmer and pastoralist communities are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that the program increases intergroup trust and physical security.  We do not find evidence for alternative mechanisms through which intergroup contact could reduce violence, such as reducing outgroup threat or expanding the conception of ingroup to include the former outgroup.  These results suggest that intergroup trust via intergroup contact can serve as social institution that solves commitment problems and promotes peace between groups in conflict. <!--Chris: maybe remove "serve as a social institutions that solves commitment problems" -->

## Abstract 4

Intergroup conflict is responsible for many of the worst displays of human nature.  In this paper we test the ability of an intergroup contact-based peacebuilding program to contribute to peace between groups involved in violent conflict.  Intergroup conflict .  However, international intervention is not always effective at reducing intergroup conflicts.  We propose psychological reconciliation through intergroup contact as an alternative to large-scale international intervention.  Groups in conflict often share mutual distrust, which make peace impossible unlikely by sabotaging intergroup bargaining.  Outside intervention often serve as substitutes for intergroup trust, but psychological reconciliation could improve intergroup trust directly.  Improved intergroup trust should allow the conflicting groups to settle disputes even in the absence of outside intervention.  We test the ability of psychological reconciliation programs to promote peace between violently conflicting groups with a field experiment in Nigeria, where farmer and pastoralist communities are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that the programs increase intergroup trust and perceptions of physical security of group members.  These results suggest that psychological reconciliation can promote peace between groups in conflict.-->


<!--intergroup contact can promote peace between groups in conflict by increasing trust that the other group will abide by its agreements.-->

<!--Abstract 5

In this paper we test the ability of intergroup contact-based interventions to contribute to peace between groups involved in violent conflict.  Intergroup conflict occurs when groups cannot negotiate to resolve disagreements.  Negotiation requires trust that the other side will abide by its agreements, but groups in conflict share mutual distrust, which sabotages negotiations.  Interventions based on intergroup contact can help groups build intergroup trust by giving each group the opportunity to update perceptions of the other side.  Improved intergroup trust should allow the conflicting groups to settle disagreements and establish or maintain peaceful relations.  We test the ability of contact-based interventions to promote peace between violently conflicting groups with a field experiment in Nigeria, where farmer and pastoralist communities are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We evaluate the program with surveys, behavioral observation, and a behavioral game.  We find that the program increases intergroup contact, intergroup trust, and perceptions of physical security of group members.  These results suggest that building trust between conflicting groups is possible, and that structured intergroup contact is a promising method to do so.
-->

<!--Abstract 6
Group conflict should be avoidable through intergroup bargaining, yet group conflict is commonplace throughout the world.  We argue that psychological phenomena account for many bargaining failures by inducing barriers to bargaining through two psychological processes.  First, psychological phenomena prevent groups from developing intergroup trust by biasing interpretations of the behavior of the other side.  Second, psychological phenomena add costs to compromise because group members derive self-esteem from feelings of group superiority.  Interventions that abate these psychological barriers to bargaining should allow the groups to avoid violent conflict.  We test the ability of a contact-based intervention to promote peace between conflicting groups with a field experiment in Nigeria, where farmer and pastoralist communities are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We evaluate the program with surveys, direct observation of behavior, and a behavioral game.  We find that participation in the program increases intergroup contact, intergroup trust, and perceptions of physical security among group members; many of the program's effects also diffuse to group members who did not directly participate in the program but who lived alongside participants.  These results suggest that reducing barriers to bargaining between conflicting groups is possible, and that structured intergroup contact is a promising method to do so.

## Thinking from Alice Presentation

chris: In intro, need ot talk about hustory of conflict reduction, contact theory.  

Intro

Conflict Reduction

Conflict reduction: want to reduce/resolve conflict with institutions/other things.  Once conflict starts, peacekeeping, police, etc... but that is expensive.  Requires coercion.  Requires outside actors.  Requires strong states, which are not present in many parts of the world with intergroup conflict.  When imposed solutions leave (like peacekeepers, imposed/coercive institutions) the groups go back to fighting.  Need grassroots solution (Ostrom on imposed norms).

- Institutions 
- Intergroup bargaining processes [@fearon; @powell](Smith and Stam 2004)
- Mutually Assured Destruction.
- increased trade relationships
- making resources less scarce

Propose intergroup contact as another potential solution to intergroup conflict.


Contact Theory
Contact theory: used to reduce prejudice, starting with african-americans and caucasians in USA, movign to other groups.  Want to use it to stop conflict.


Theory

Would think ECPN would not work because ECPN does not employ institutions to prevent conflict, intervene through mediation, directly affect the bargaining process or intergroup trade relationships, or change the scarcity of the resources the groups fight over.

Would think ECPN would work because it uses intergroup contact, increased resources.  Intergroup contact could affect trust, which could improve bargaining and trade relationships.

# Scacco abstract
Can positive social contact between members of antagonistic groups reduce prejudice and discrimination? Despite extensive research on social contact, observational studies are difficult to interpret because prejudiced people may select out of contact with out-group members. We overcome this problem by conducting an education-based, randomized field experiment—the Urban Youth Vocational Training program (UYVT)—with 849 randomly sampled Christian and Muslim young men in riot-prone Kaduna, Nigeria. After sixteen weeks of positive intergroup social contact, we find no changes in prejudice, but heterogeneous-class subjects discriminate significantly less against out-group members than subjects in homogeneous classes.  We trace this finding to increased discrimination by homogeneous-class subjects compared to non-UYVT study participants, and we highlight potentially negative consequences of in-group social contact. By focusing on skill-building instead of peace messaging, our intervention minimizes reporting bias and offers strong experimental evidence that intergroup social contact can alter behavior in constructive ways, even amid violent conflict.

# Enos abstract
The effect of intergroup contact has long been a question central to social scientists. As
political and technological changes bring increased interstate immigration, understanding
intergroup contact and demographic change is increasingly important to policy and scientifc
debates. Unfortunately, limitations in causal inference with observational data and the
practical inability to experiment on demographic context have constrained scholars' ability to
speak to the effects of intergroup contact. Here I report the results of an experiment testing
the causal effects of prolonged intergroup contact in which Spanish-speaking confederates
were randomly assigned to be inserted, for an extended period, into the daily routines of
unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus
simulating the conditions of demographic change. The result of this controlled experiment
is a signifcant shift toward exclusionary attitudes among treated subjects. However there is
evidence that the initial aversion diminishes over time. This experiment demonstrates that
even very minor demographic change causes strong exclusionary reactions.
