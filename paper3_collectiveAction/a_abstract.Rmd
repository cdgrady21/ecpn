## Abstract

<!--Group conflict of all types plagues humanity's dealings with itself.  -->Group conflict can occur because one or both sides prefer fighting to peace, but often conflict occurs despite both side's desire for peace.  In these cases, conflict is often caused by an information problem, wherein groups don't know each other's preferences, or a commitment problem, wherein neither side trusts the other to honor agreements.  

Peace is a public good, so the commitment problem can be solved if groups have ways to compel radical group members to honor agreements + signal the ability and intent to compel radicals to other side.  Psychological barriers like prejudice may prevent groups from desiring peace/wanting to prevent radicals, and from sending/receiving signals about commitment to peace.  Intergroup contact that achieves a joint goal can remove prejudice, provide incentive for peace and cooperation, and allow signals to be more accurately perceived.  To send strong, unambiguous signals, however, both groups must be involved in punishing defectors: only ingroup punishing their own can be perceived as too lenient, only outgroup punishing other side can be perceived as too harsh.  I apply this perspective to the the cases of farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria.  I close by discussing outstanding issues, such as initiating the onset of joint-punishment institutions, and implications for peacebuilding programs.
