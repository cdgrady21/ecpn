-	Give groups incentive to solve collective action problem: Norms for cooperation
-	Reduces psych biases to perception: removes stereotypes, anxiety/threat; adds empathy, identification of similarities/joint interests.  Something needs to grease the gears.
-	Provides opportunity for costly signaling: groups interact and can directly observe outgroup’s preferences and behavior.  Confidence-building measure.

<!---	real situation that is an iterative Prisoner’s Dilemma -->
When groups are cooperating, misperceptions are a major danger to continued cooperation.  To see why, imagine that two groups are cooperating over a joint feast.  One group is charged with bringing meat and milk, the other with bringing vegetables and grains.  Imagine the vegetable and grain side contributes less than their fair share due to a bad harvest.  What should the other side do?  Since they do not know why the other side has come without sufficient food, they cannot rule out the possibility that the other side is being treacherous.  Do they allow the non-contributors to partake in the feast, or do they take their food and go home?  If they allow the non-contributors to join the feast, they might be preserving cooperative relations and ensuring future feasts, which is good for both sides.  Or they might be allowing the other side to get away with betrayal, which is bad for their side and good for the side of the non-contributors.[^IPD]

[^IPD]: This situation follows @axelrod1981evolution and @fearon1996explaining in conceptualizing intergroup cooperation as an iterative prisoners dilemma.  Two groups interact simultaneously for an unlimited number of rounds, either cooperating or defecting.  Both sides most prefer to defect when the other cooperates and least prefer to cooperate when the other defects; mutual cooperation is the pareto efficient outcome in that it maximizes overall value.  When each side cooperates, there is a small chance that it accidentally defects or that it's cooperation gets interpreted as defection.

In this scenario, both sides have intended to cooperate, but one side's attempt to cooperate looks like defection.  Since both group's prefer to cooperate, mutual cooperation can only be interrupted by an accident (one side tries to cooperate and accidentally defects) or misinterpretation (one side cooperates but it gets interpreted as defection).  In this case, the continuation of cooperation depends on the meat and milk side perceiving the grain and vegetable side's meager contribution as cooperation and not defection.  If their perceptions are biased against the outgroup, they may attribute the lack of food to ill intent.

The problem of misperceptions is exacerbated when considering the groups as collections of individuals with different preferences.  Rather than the groups meeting to cooperate or defect, members of each group meet to cooperate or defect.  Imagine a member of Group A defects against a member of Group B.  If the groups are relying on each side to punish their own, then Group A punishes their defector.  Suppose he defects against Group B again at his next opportunity.  It may appear to Group B that (1) Group A has not punished their own group member, so he continues to defect, or (2) Group A's punishment against their own group member was too lenient.  In either scenario, Group B might punish him more harshly to deter future defection.^[Ingroup policing has many virtues over other means to punish defectors.  Most important is that the ingroup is most likely to know who defected, whereas the outgroup is only likely to know that someone from the other group defected [@fearon1996explaining].]

<!--

-->
Since Group B does not have a say in Group A's punishment, they must trust that Group A punishes their defectors and does so sufficiently to deter future defection.  But neither group can know with certainty how much punishment is "enough" to deter future defection, so some punishments are bound to fail.  These failures can delegitimize the institution of ingroup policing unless the groups share a substantial amount of intergroup trust.  This amount of intergroup trust is unlikely to characterize the relationships of groups in or with a recent history of violent conflict.

-	Joint punishment: both groups decide together.  Pros/cons. -->
Rather than the institution of ingroup policing as the way for groups to ensure cooperation, I suggest that many groups use collaborative "joint-punishment" institutions.  These collaborative institutions involve representatives from both sides who jointly decide on an appropriate punishment for any behavior in which a member of one group harms a member of the other.  Having both groups involved vastly reduces the possibility that either side believes a defector went unpunished or misperceives a genuine attempt at punishment as overly lenient.  It maintains the main benefit of ingroup policing in that each group still helps identify their defecting group members but does more to sheild both groups from the temptation to punish outgroup defection themselves.


<!--
To see why misperceptions are such a danger to intergroup cooperation and trust, imagine two groups contributing to a joint meal.  One brings meat and milk, the other brings vegetables and grains.  They each bring as much food as they can and split the food evenly amongst themselves.  Each group most prefers to eat their own food and the food of the other side and least prefers to share their own food and get nothing from the other side; the outcome that maximizes overall utility is that both group's contribute equally to the meal.

Imagine that the two groups have been cooperating successfully for multiple days, each group bringing similar amounts of food to the meal.  Now imagine the next day one group contributes very little.  How does the other group respond?  Do they split their food evenly, even though their partners did not contribute their fair share, or do they cancel the joint meal and keep their food for themselves?  If they do not split their food, they run the risk of breaking down the cooperative dynamics the two groups have achieved.  If they do split their food, however, they may be allowing the other side to get away with betrayal, signaling that they are "suckers".

The question is: why did the first group not contribute their share of food?  Did they intend to contribute but were prevented by events outside their control?  Or

## What is needed for peace

(1) Persuade each group to want peace enough to punish ingroup members who do not, (2) persuade each group that the other wants peace and will punish ingroup members.  (2) theory of mind/social cognition: group members will put themselves in the mind of outgroup members and imagine what the outgroup will do.  To persuade each group that the other wants peace, must remove psychological barriers to perceiving other group's behavior. 

For groups to want peace, they must perceive that the benefits of peace outweigh the benefits of fighting; a solution should both increase the expected payoff of peace (through examples of cross-group cooperation working well), encourage seeking absolute gains over relative gains, and reduce psychological benefits from harming outgroup.


## Challenges to peace

Risk of cooperation being perceived as defection.  Also risk of defection being perceived as cooperation (an accident), and the worry that ingroup will not punish outgroup defection.


## How contact helps

Intergroup contact can remove stereotypes, reduce feeling of threat, engender feelings of empathy, and make commonalities salient [@allport1954prejudice; @pettigrew2008does; @page2008little; @batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably; @gaertner1993common].  

Intergroup contact can serve as confidence-building measure by giving each group the opportunity to send costly signals of cooperative intent and willingness to punish ingroup offenders.
