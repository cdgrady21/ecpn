II: Non-material factors that cause conflict, including collective action problem
-	Adding costs to peace
    -	Constraints on leaders
-	Adding value to fighting
-	Biasing perceptions (even if groups prefer peace to fighting)
-	Difficulty solving collective action problem: harm ingroup members for benefit of group.


Psych: how Players can signal their intention to cooperate.  In the Trust Game, "trust can be a product of several things." [@kydd2000trust, p.331].  

Bargaining perspective uses psychological concepts used to explain conflict.  Commitment problems, for example, are about the psychological state of trust.  But I believe the identity perspective has much to offer the bargaining perspective.  Specifically, the identity perspective highlights many of the non-material factors that contribute to information problems, commitment problems, and preference problems.

<!--4 - general problems with rep/repeated interactions: don't want peace because psych costs; even if want peace, incentive to act tough to get best deal; even if want peace and not acting tough, biased perceptions of outgroup means each group is likely to misinterpret each other's cooperative signals.-->
Solving commitment problems through repeated interactions also faces limitations, however, especially for groups in or with a history of conflict.  Repeated interactions only solve commitment problems if both groups prefer peace (cooperation) to fighting (defection).  Though peace is in each group's material interest, preferences often deviate from material interest [@fehr2002social].  In the case of conflict, groups may not want peace because they derive psychological benefit from feelings of group superiority and from harm to a hated outgroup [@weisel2015ingroup; @cikara2014their; @tajfel2981groups; @fein1997prejudice] and when their animosity leads them to prefer relative gains over the outgroup to absolute gains for themselves [@waltz2010theory; @halevy2010relative; @turner1979social; @tajfel1971social].  Even if groups desire peace, they maintain an incentive to act "tough" to get the best deal, and so may not signal their desire for peace [@ross1995psychological].  And even if groups signal their desire for peace, phenomena like confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, and motivated reasoning can bias perceptions of outgroup behavior and prevent groups from accurately perceiving peaceful intentions [@de2008motivated; @ward1997naive; @duncan1976differential; @vallone1985hostileMedia; @festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @kunda1990motivatedReasoning; @tajfel1969cognitive; @nickerson1998confirmation].  These non-material factors can prevent future interactions from solving groups' commitment problem.



# Applying the Identity Perspective to Bargaining

Violent conflict is not materially rational because it destroys the resources groups are fighting for.  As such, several non-material factors should contribute to conflict.  By looking at groups as a collection of individual group members, I identify two main ways that these non-material factors contribute to conflict.  First, they shrink the range of peace agreements that each side prefers to peace by adding costs to peace and benefits to fighting.  Second, they bias perceptions of the other side's preferences such that neither side thinks the other prefers peace or can be trusted to abide by peace agreements.  I also identify an internal collective action problem that leads to conflict and explain why that problem is exceptionally difficult for group's to solve.

<!--costs to peace:
(1) self-esteem loss
(2) cost of losing justification for past aggressive/discriminatory behaviors
(3) general costs to attitude change: I thought those people were bad, now we're supposed to work with them?
(4) cost of changing norms/institutions that discriminated against the outgroup.
(5) domestic audience costs to leaders?
(6) making peace with an enemy?
(7) sunk cost fallacy / "dissonant...to accept terms today that could have been achieved, without the ensuing costs...,at some earlier point in time."-->

## Costs of Peace and Benefits of Fighting

@horowitz2001deadly and @petersen2002understanding show how "emotions stemming from past interethnic violence serve as impediments to peaceful resolutions to present-day conflicts". (from Little and Zeitzoff)

<!--chris: be clear that adding costs to peace does not make groups necessarily "prefer fighting to peace", but may make them prefer fighting to the set of bargains the other side will agree to.-->

Non-material factors add costs to peace in three main ways: (1) costs of changing attitudes and institutions, (2) loss of self-esteem, and (3) loss of sunk costs.  First, to the extent that accepting peace requires individuals in the group to change attitudes about the outgroup, group members must accept the psychological costs of attitude change.  Individuals use many strategies to maintain existing attitudes -- searching for information that confirms pre-existing beliefs, counter-arguing information divergent with their beliefs -- suggesting that costs to attitude change are not insubstantial [@nickerson1998confirmation; @kunda1990motivatedReasoning].  Changing negative attitudes towards an enemy may be especially challenging because negative outgroup attitudes are supported by a "sociopsychological infrastructure" that feeds conflict [@bar2007sociopsychological].  At the group-level, a peace agreement requires groups to dismantle the sociopsychological infrastructure that fed conflict and any social norms/institutions developed from it that encouraged violence against the outgroup [@bornstein2003intergroup].  Those institutions must be reformed to prevent, not encourage, intergroup violence.

Second, peace agreements may cause a loss of self-esteem for individual group members.  Group members derive self-esteem from positively comparing their group to a rival group, and and any agreement in which their side acknowledges the legitimacy of the other challenges this group-based boost to self-esteem [@tajfel1981groups; @wood2000attitude; @tajfel1979integrative; @fein1997prejudice; @martiny2012shall; @brown2019group].  Group members may also pay psychological costs to their self-esteem from losing their rationalization for engaging in discriminatory or aggressive behaviors towards outgroup members.  People rationalize their behavior to maintain a moral self-image [@bandura1999moral; @bandura2014social; @mazar2008dishonesty], and people who harmed the outgroup must come to terms with past behaviors that are now deemed immoral.

Third, individuals are affected by the sunk cost fallacy and want the gain from a peace deal to make up for the cost of fighting even though those costs were already born [@arkes1985psychology].  Accepting a peace agreement after fighting that could have been achieved without fighting is to admit that past behavior was a mistake, and people are loathe to admit their mistakes [@tavris2008mistakes].  It is "dissonant for the disputing parties to accept terms today that could have been achieved, without the ensuing costs, at some earlier point in time" [@ross1995psychological, p.264].

[chris: I feel that sunk costs are important but I have not yet been able to articulate it well. Is it a loss of self-esteem?]

<!--Example of costs to peace. harm, discrimination. -->
To see how these psychological costs to peace might sabotage peace efforts, imagine that groups fighting over land sign a peace agreement that assigns some land to each group.  This agreement may make material sense in that each group can enjoy the benefits of some land instead of fighting for all of it.  But in addition to the material cost of losing potential access to land granted to the other side, each group must begin punishing outgroup violence rather than encouraging it.  Individuals in the group must adjust their behavior to conform to new norms and rethink the status of their group relative to the outgroup; they can no longer "bask in the reflected glory" of their group's superiority [@brown2019group, p.312].  Individuals who felt justified in overcharged outgroup members for services or physically harming outgroup members are now told that such behaviors are wrong and immoral.  Individuals must also accept that their sacrifices to benefit fighting -- dead friends and loved ones, material deprivation, time and energy spent fighting -- were for naught: the sacrifices did not help the group win.  Sustaining conflict against the outgroup allows group members to maintain existing attitudes and behaviors and preserves the possibility that their group will be victorious.

<!--Benefit to fighting-->
Other than avoiding these costs, group members may prefer fighting due to its non-material benefits.  First, group members may feel pleasure in response to outgroup pain [@weisel2015ingroup; @cikara2014their].  This pleasure adds psychological utility to participating in conflict for individual group members.  Second, individuals may like gaining glory and other social rewards for participating in violent conflict.  Societies use various social carrots and sticks to encourage participation in conflict [@gneezy2012conflict], and group members give up those rewards when conflict ends.  These social rewards add social utility to participating in conflict.  Third, in addition to non-material benefits of fighting, each side may overestimate their chances of victory, causing them to discount the costs of conflict [@johnson2009overconfidence].


<!--Costs to peace, benefits to fighting: no possible peace agreements -->
As a result of these costs to peace and benefits to conflict, there may exist no peace agreement that both sides prefer to fighting.  Each side prefers mutual cooperation in repeated interactions only if their utility from mutual cooperation exceeds their utility from mutual defection.  Due to non-material costs of peace and benefits of fighting, sides may prefer fighting, to say nothing of each side's tendency to overestimate their chances of victory [@johnson2009overconfidence]  Even if sides do not overestimate their chance of victory, each side may only accept a peace agreement that materially favor their side because the material gains from peace must overcome its non-material costs.  Indeed, many group members are willing to accept lower absolute gains to increase relative gain over the outgroup [@turner1970social; @waltz2010theory; @halevy2010relative;].  The preference for gains relative to the outgroup makes any mutually beneficial peace agreement impossible.

[chris: tikz graph showing payoffs?  "Conflict often discussed as an iterative PD.  In one-off, both sides prefer to defect, but in repeated interactions each side cooperates if their cooperation incites cooperation in the other side.  But adding costs to cooperation and benefits to fighting change that calculus."]

## Biased Perceptions

<!--Bias perceptions-->
Though non-material factors can increase the costs of peace and increase benefits of conflict, the high cost of conflict may be such that both sides still prefer peace.  Even when both sides prefer peace, psychological biases can prevent each side from accurately perceiving the other's desire for peace and negotiating a peace agreement.  This happens in two main ways: (1) cognitive dissonance, motivated reasoning, and confirmation bias[^biasDefs1] cause each side to interpret the other's behavior in a way that supports existing negative attitudes and (2) loss aversion and reactive devaluation[^biasDefs2] cause the two sides to overvalue concessions they give up and undervalue concessions they receive.  These phenomena introduce significant friction in the ability of groups to build trusting relationships and avoid conflict.

[^biasDefs1]: _Cognitive dissonance_ is the mental discomfort that occurs when one individual holds two contradictory beliefs.  Individuals resolve this dissonance by rejecting one of the contradictory beliefs [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @tavris2008mistakes].  Individuals tend to resolve this dissonance by rejecting the newer or less central belief because it is costly to reject older and more central beliefs [@schwartz1990towards; @converse1970attitudes; @bryan2019values].  _Motivated reasoning_ and _confirmation bias_ are related concepts.  Motivated reasoning is the tendency for individuals to "reason" in whatever way allows them to reach their desired conclusion [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning].  Confirmation bias is the tendency for individuals to interpret new information and search memory for information to confirm existing beliefs [@nickerson1998confirmation].

[^biasDefs2]: _Loss aversion_ refers to individuals' tendency to avoid losses more than they seek equivalent gains [@kahneman2013prospect].  Reactive devaluation is the tendency for individuals to undervalue concessions and proposals from antagonists [@ward1997naive; @ross1991barriers].

Cognitive dissonance, motivated reasoning, and confirmation bias cause group members to interpret and recall outgroup behavior in negative ways that prevent building trust.  Defensive action by outgroup members may be interpreted as belligerent and threatening while belligerent action by one's own group is seen as defensive and justified [@ward1997naive; @duncan1976differential; @vallone1985hostileMedia]; positive actions by outgroup members may be re-interpreted as negative to avoid cognitive dissonance [@gubler2013humanizing; @paolini2010negative; @good2000individuals]; and unequivocally positive behavior may be dismissed as an exception while negative attributes are believed to define all outgroup members [@hewstone1990ultimate].  These phenomena can prevent costly signals of cooperative intent, one of the main ways groups solve commitment problems, from being interpreted accurately and reassuring each side of the other's desire for peace [@kydd2000trust; @rohner2013war; @gambetta_ch13].  <!--chris: cut this because seemed to be overkill.
When recalling information about the outgroup, individuals selectively recall events that corroborate their pre-existing negative perceptions [@de2008motivated].-->

<!--paragraph about loss aversion and reactive devaluation -->
If groups manage to signal their desire for peace despite these psychological biases, loss aversion and reactive devaluation can sabotage the negotiation process.  Individuals tend to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains, so anything the group gives up may be magnified in importance [@kahneman2013prospect].  At the same time, individuals tend to undervalue concessions from antagonists [@ward1997naive; @ross1991barriers].  These biased valuations of concessions made and concessions given can prevent groups from reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  They also interfere with group's sending costly signals of cooperative intent by lowering the perceived costliness of any cooperative signal.

<!--Example: Imagine members of two conflicting groups.
chris: decided to forego another example paragraph.-->

<!--Limited opportunities for interaction -->
Compounding these perceptual problems, intergroup trust is hampered by a lack of opportunities to learn about the other side.  Groups in conflict tend to limit contact between the two sides [@bornstein2003intergroup], so most learning must come from observing the outgroup's interactions with other groups.  Even if those opportunities are available, few of the outgroup's interactions will be with groups that are relevant for predicting the outgroup's behavior towards the ingroup, reducing the usefulness of observational learning [@kazdin1974covertModeling; @yang2013similarity]. The main opportunity to observe outgroup behavior and learn their reputation is the ingroup's own interactions with the outgroup, which are limited and hampered by perceptual biases.


## Solutions in the Identity Perspective

Contact.  Contact (1) changes incentives for fighting and peace, debiases perceptions, and provides opportunities for costly signaling.

## Problem of Collective Action


<!--Bleak picture; next section potential solution. -->
This is a bleak picture.  Repeated interactions can create the trust needed for long-term peace, but getting cooperation started is difficult because of psychological costs to cooperation, incentives to increase bargaining power by acting uncooperative, and cognitive biases that prevent groups from receiving each other's cooperative signals.  And beyond signaling the intent of the group's majority to abide by peace agreements, groups must go further and signal their willingness and capacity to punish their own group members if a group member defects on the agreement.

<!--7 - Insights from psych on how to change attitudes and relieve biased perceptions.  Intergroup contact to achieve goal. Groups expect the other side to do what is in their interest; if each side recognizes that the other will cooperate out of self-interest, can trust other side to cooperate.

Contact gives groups a reason to get along.  Contact is Confidence-building measure, costly signal. chris: Need to incorporate.

the solution needs to (1) remove psych costs to peace and psych/social barriers to trusting other side, (2) signal that each group has solved its collective action problem and can compel radical group members to not take aggressive action against outgroup.
-->
Despite the bleakness, insights from psychology and political science provide means to overcome the issues that prevent groups from developing trust in repeated interactions.  When repeated interactions help groups cooperate they do so because each group sees that peaceful cooperation is in both their interests; repeated interactions fail to bring about peace when groups prefer fighting or when groups think the other side prefers fighting.  To help groups overcome their commitment problems through repeated interactions, an intervention must shift preferences towards peace and provide an opportunity for each group to observe this preference in the other.  Structured intergroup contact -- cross-group interactions in which groups cooperate to achieve shared goals -- can show groups that peace is in both their interests, remove the psychological barriers to each group identifying that the other wants peace, and provide opportunities for each group to send costly signals of their intent to cooperate and willingness to punish ingroup members who do not.  Achieving a joint goal demonstrates to each group that both their interests are best served through cooperation.  The prospect of benefit through cross-group cooperation motivates cooperation and attitude change [@grady2020lab; @rohner2013war] as well as the adoption of group norms to ensure cooperation, like punishment of ingroup members whose behavior undermines peace [@axelrod1986evolutionary; @fearon1996explaining].  Believing that the other side wants peace also creates the expectation that the other side will solve its collective action problem and police their own because it is in their interest to do so.

<!--Reactive devaluation applies to ingroup policing: "If they are willing to punish X, then the punishment must not be very severe."

@nadler2006intergroup showed that expressions of empathy worsened attitudes towards outgroup unless a basic level of trust was present.-->

## Problems with 3rd parties specific to heterogeneous groups

Not good when conflict too decentralized for a third party to effectively mediate or intervene.

Third parties should also face specific limitations enforcing agreements among heterogeneous and decentralized groups.  The punishment used by the third party must be applied to those who would defect on the agreement if it is to deter their defection.  This process works better for homogeneous groups like armies, where responsibility for the behavior of any group member can be assigned to the group as a whole, than for heterogeneous groups, where identification and punishment must occur at a much more granular level.  Punishing the entire group for the behavior of a few radicals will likely undermine the third party's credibility, rather than promote peace.^[Many instances of conflict, even those described as wars, are often characterized by small-scale fighting by decentralized groups.  Most of the fighting in what are today called the American Indian Wars took this form, as did the range wars and sheep wars of the American West, present conflicts between farmers and pastoralist in the African Sahel, and many insurgencies involving autonomous insurgent groups.]

specific problems: cannot have repeated interactions with most outgroup members; most of the group can be trusted and thought to have good intentions, but peace can be derailed by a few radicals.
Repeated interactions also face problems specific to heterogeneous groups.  If groups are heterogeneous, repeated action with each outgroup member unlikely.  Reputation.
