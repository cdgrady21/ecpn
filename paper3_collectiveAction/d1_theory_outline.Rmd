IIIa: Intergroup contact to remove those factors
-	Make groups want peace: Goal achievement through cooperation: cooperation in each group’s interest
-	Give groups incentive to solve collective action problem: Norms for cooperation
-	Reduces psych biases to perception: removes stereotypes, anxiety/threat; adds empathy, identification of similarities/joint interests.  Something needs to grease the gears.
-	Provides opportunity for costly signaling: groups interact and can directly observe outgroup’s preferences and behavior.  Confidence-building measure.

# Intergroup Contact














**********

## What is needed for peace

(1) Persuade each group to want peace enough to punish ingroup members who do not, (2) persuade each group that the other wants peace and will punish ingroup members.  (2) theory of mind/social cognition: group members will put themselves in the mind of outgroup members and imagine what the outgroup will do.  To persuade each group that the other wants peace, must remove psychological barriers to perceiving other group's behavior. 

For groups to want peace, they must perceive that the benefits of peace outweigh the benefits of fighting; a solution should both increase the expected payoff of peace (through examples of cross-group cooperation working well), encourage seeking absolute gains over relative gains, and reduce psychological benefits from harming outgroup.


## Challenges to peace

Risk of cooperation being perceived as defection.  Also risk of defection being perceived as cooperation (an accident), and the worry that ingroup will not punish outgroup defection.


## How contact helps

Intergroup contact can remove stereotypes, reduce feeling of threat, engender feelings of empathy, and make commonalities salient [@allport1954prejudice; @pettigrew2008does; @page2008little; @batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably; @gaertner1993common].  

Intergroup contact can serve as confidence-building measure by giving each group the opportunity to send costly signals of cooperative intent and willingness to punish ingroup offenders.
