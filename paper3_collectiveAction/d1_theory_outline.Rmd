IIIa: Intergroup contact to remove those factors
-	Make groups want peace: Goal achievement through cooperation: cooperation in each group’s interest
-	Give groups incentive to solve collective action problem: Norms for cooperation
-	Reduces psych biases to perception: removes stereotypes, anxiety/threat; adds empathy, identification of similarities/joint interests.  Something needs to grease the gears.
-	Provides opportunity for costly signaling: groups interact and can directly observe outgroup’s preferences and behavior.  Confidence-building measure.

# Intergroup Contact














**********

## How contact helps

Intergroup contact can remove stereotypes, reduce feeling of threat, engender feelings of empathy, and make commonalities salient [@allport1954prejudice; @pettigrew2008does; @page2008little; @batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably; @gaertner1993common].  

Intergroup contact can serve as confidence-building measure by giving each group the opportunity to send costly signals of cooperative intent and willingness to punish ingroup offenders.
