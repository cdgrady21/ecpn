VI: Avenues for Empirical Research

- More putting together of bargaining and identity perspective; other perspectives on group conflict.
- Collective action problems as potential driver of between-group commitment problems.
- Ingroup policing as potentially unsustainable due to perceptual biases and reactive devaluation?
- Collaborative institutions for ensuring peace, like joint-punishment institutions of Nigerian farmers and pastoralists.
-	Test contact programs with groups in conflict and with history of conflict.
-	Compare contact programs that do and do not (1) work to achieve goal, (2) actually achieve it.
-	Best means to demonstrate material rationality of peace.  Trade, differentiated groups?
- Best means to reduce psych/cognitive biases
-	Need for enforcement at onset to incentivize Cooperation?
-	Role of elites: contact says they must support
-	Difficulty with very decentralized groups
-	Power disparities between groups
-	Contactâ€™s differential effects with these power disparities.
- How to get things started?
- Network graph showing how often poli econ and poli psych stuff cite themselves and not other perspective's articles.


# Avenues for Future Research

This paper sought to show how combining two perspectives on group conflict, the bargaining perspective and the identity perspective, can provide a better understanding of the causes and consequences of group conflict.  Doing so reveals several avenues for future research.  The first avenue is to synthesize models of group conflict from the numerous disciplines that study it.  Group conflict is an interdisciplinary research topic with scholarship in political science [@lopez2017determinants], economics [@kimbrough2017war], psychology [@bohm2018psychology], management science [@mccarter2018models], biology [@rusch2017logic], and evolutionary anthropology [@glowacki2017evolutionary].  Each discipline emphasizes different causes and consequences of group conflict.  A synthesis of perspectives from these distinct viewpoints could provide insights into causes of conflict and more effective methods to reduce it.

The second avenue is to further consider the role that collective action problems play in group conflict.  As we saw with farmer-pastoralist conflict and as has been written about by @fearon1996explaining and @sambanis2013social, among others, peace can be derailed by a small set of group members who refuse to "play ball" with the other side.  Without the ability to compel cooperative behavior from group members, groups cannot credibly commit to honor negotiated agreements.  This points to within-group collective action problems as the driver of some between-group commitment problems.  Peace is a public good: group members must forego behaviors that benefit them individually for peace to be achieved, but once achieved all group members enjoy its benefits whether or not they bore its costs.  

Overcoming collective action problems is notoriously difficult.  In the case of intergroup conflict, collective action problems may be even more difficult to solve because costs must be born before benefits are obtained, and group members may be killed in the meantime and thus never enjoy the benefits of their sacrifice.  Individuals are notoriously bad even at saving for retirement, where they can sacrifice now to benefit themselves later in a low-risk environment [@benartzi2013behavioral; @warner2001personal].  Individuals may rationally discount future payoffs quite significantly in conflict settings where individuals may never see the future and the benefits accrue to a group.

Bornstein (@bornstein1992free and @bornstein2003intergroup) was among the first to consider how groups dealt with the preferences of individual group members in the context of group conflict.  His focus, and the focus of most subsequent scholarship, was how groups encourage group members to participate in violence against the other side, since winning the fight benefits all group members but only group members who fight bear the costs.  Most literature about collective action problems in conflict is thus concerned with each group's attempt to compel group members to _fight_ the other side or resist external pressure; relatively little has been written about each group's attempt to compel group members to _cooperate_ with the other side [@keefer2012follow; @kaplan2010civilian; @rubin2020rebel].

Implicit in the discussion of collective action problems is that groups are made up of individuals with preferences that differ from the group.  Following that logic, war may not be equally costly to all members of society, and peace not equally beneficial.  The public good of peace is more beneficial for some group members than for others.  In the case of farmers and pastoralists, farmers on the outskirts of the community bear the brunt of "defections" during peace time, so peace may not be more costly than war for them.  If group elites bear few costs from conflict and may suffer in prestige from peace, they could resist peace agreements.  Future scholarship should consider who bears the costs of conflict and who stands to benefit from peace.

A third avenue for future research is to study the manner in which groups solve their own commitment problems, with an eye to the within-group collective problem as the driver of the between-group commitment problem.  @fearon1996explaining showed that ingroup policing, an institution wherein groups punish their own miscreants, can help groups avoid an escalation of intergroup violence.  They credit the relative paucity of group conflict to such institutions.  Ingroup policing is an excellent example of within-group institutions that prevent violence from escalating and for maintaining peace in many contexts.  

Consideration of perceptual biases and mistrust between groups in or with a recent history of conflict indicates a potential limitation of ingroup policing in violent contexts.  With ingroup policing, groups are restrained from overly lenient punishment of their own people by the threat of violence escalating if either group suspects the other of acting in bad faith.  Since ingroup policing depends on the perceptions of group members, if those perceptions are biased such that members of each group suspect the other is trying to take advantage of the ingroup policing institution, then the institution could break down as each group does not trust the other to allocate sufficient punishment to their own side.  Groups could account for the biases of the other side and punish harshly to overcome the bias, but overly harsh punishments could reduce the legitimacy of ingroup policing among the ingroup.

Need to think about ways to reduce the biases that cause misperceptions and a modification of ingroup policing that should be less susceptible to misperceptions when they do occur.


## Joint-Punishment Institutions

Intergroup contact is not a panacea, however, and groups can still misperceive the behavior and intentions of the other side.  When both groups desire cooperation, the risk of cooperative behavior being misperceived as uncooperative behavior is the main threat to enduring peace [@jervis2017misperception; @wu1995cope; @bendor1991doubt].  If groups trust each other to police their own, each side must worry that the other group will not punish their own members with sufficient force to deter their harmful or discriminatory actions.  Groups are, after all, biased in favor of their own side.  Groups need a collaborative institutional structure to minimize misperceptions and their effect.


<!--8 - Mistakes happen; need to reduce chances for misinterpretation of other side's signals.  Joint-punishment apparatus. Not ingroup policing-->
Intergroup contact is a good first step to show groups that both benefit from cooperation and help groups send and receive signals of cooperation.  Even if contact reduces biases that cause misperceptions of these signals, however, misperceptions are still possible and can derail cooperative equilibria [@jervis2017misperception; @wu1995cope; @bendor1991doubt].  Members of one group may accidentally engage in action that harms the other or may perceive outgroup behavior as aggressive when it is not.  For long-term peace, institutions must minimize and manage these misperceptions.

One common mechanism for reducing group conflict is ingroup policing in which each side polices its own miscreants [@fearon1996explaining].  Ingroup policing is generally an excellent institution for preventing escalations of violence and for maintaining peace.  The research summarized in this paper, however, suggests that mistrust between groups in or with a recent history of conflict may make ingroup policing unsustainable as a solution to prevent violence because of the potential for one group to devalue the costs imposed by the ingroup on their defector.  Groups in conflict reactively devalue costly behaviors done by the other side [@ward1997naive; @ross1995psychological; @maoz2002reactive; @millard2018testing] on the logic that "$X$ behavior must not be very costly, since they were willing to do it" (@kahneman1992reference calls a similar phenomenon "concession aversion").  This reactive devaluation causes problems for ingroup policing, since it can create the perception that any ingroup punishment was too lenient.  This can cause the outgroup to exact their own punishment, which may be viewed as too harsh, causing a spiral of violence.  Instead of ingroup policing, perhaps misperceptions could be minimized by a peace agreement in which both groups are involved in the punishment of defectors who harm their outgorup.  The involvement of both groups minimizes the possibility that either side believes the punishment was too lenient or harsh.^[The ingroup could of course account for this bias and assign even harsher punishments to ingroup defectors, but those excessive punishments may reduce support for ingroup policing because group views the punishment as disproportionate to the crime.]

The possibility of ingroup policing being unsustainable due to misperceptions, and of the potential for joint-punishment institutions to reduce misperceptions, should be considered in future research.
