VI: Avenues for Empirical Research

-	Test contact programs with groups in conflict and with history of conflict.  Look for collaborative institutions.

-	Compare contact programs that do and do not (1) work to achieve goal, (2) actually achieve it.

-	Best means to demonstrate material rationality of peace.  Trade, differentiated groups?

- Best means to reduce psych/cognitive biases

-	Need for enforcement at onset to incentivize Cooperation?

-	Role of elites: contact says they must support

-	Difficulty with very decentralized groups

-	Power disparities between groups

-	Contact’s differential effects with these power disparities.

- How to get things started?

- Network graph showing how often poli econ and poli psych stuff cite themselves and not other perspective's articles.


# Avenues for Future Research

## Collective Action Problems

<!--Collective Action leads to commitment problems/lack of trust between groups.  There is a within-group Collective action problem in addition to a between-group commitment problem.  Groups made of individuals.  What does it mean to trust a group?  It means trusting that sufficient number of group members will cooperate and that they can and will compel other group members who do not want to cooperate.  Sambanis: “peace can be derailed by a few radicals.” Beyond most members of a group signaling a commitment to peace, they must also signal a willingness and capacity to punish ingroup members who do not contribute to peace.  -->

An additional challenge with building trust between groups has not received much attention in the literature: each group faces a within-group collective action problem in addition to the between-group commitment problem.  The collective action problem occurs because each group is a collection of individual group members with their own behavioral incentives, not cohesive entities.  Peace benefits all members of a group, but contributing to peace is costly for group members because they must refrain from engaging in behaviors that benefit themselves at the expense of the outgroup.  Achieving peace, as with any public good, requires overcoming this collective action problem: the group must compel group members to contribute to peace despite the members' individual incentive to shirk and rely on others to bear its cost.  <!--What does it mean for a group to trust another group?-->One group trusting the other to honor an agreement, then, means not only trusting that a high proportion of outgroup members desire peace, but also that those outgroup members can and will compel less cooperative group members to honor a peace agreement [@fearon1996explaining].  Peace, after all, can be derailed by a few radicals [@sambanis2013social; @de2009effects].

Implicitly identified by @fearon1996explaining.  This within-group collective action problem illustrates that most groups are a collection of individual group members with their own behavioral incentives, not cohesive entities.  Without considering groups as collections of individuals, theories of group conflict  reveals a potential source of between-group commitment problems: a within-group collective action problem.  

Most literature about collective action problems in conflict concern each group's attempt to compel group members to _fight_ the other side, not each group's attempt to compel group members to _cooperate_ with the other side.

Especially interesting when costs of peace and war are not standard across all group members.  Certain group members may be more likely to benefit from peace, while others bear the costs of peace.  In the case of farmers and pastoralists, farmers on the outskirts of the community bear the brunt of "defections" during peace time, so peace may not be more costly than war for them.


<!--chris: do I need to say something about third party actors being unable to solve group's internal collective action problem? -->

#### Collective Action Problem

from Nuole: war not equally costly to all members of society; peace no equally beneficial.  Public good better for some people than for others.

<!--Problem of collective action -->
Implicit in the discussion of these non-material factors is that groups are made up of individuals and that individual cognitive and psychological biases influence conflict dynamics.  Following that logic -- that groups are collections of individuals with preferences that may differ from the group as a whole -- leads to an additional challenge to groups' negotiating peace agreements: peace is a public good.  Group members must refrain from behavior that benefits them individually at the expense of the outgroup, but if peace is achieved group members enjoy its benefits whether or not they bore its costs.  Without the ability to compel behavior for the public good, groups cannot credibly commit to honor negotiated agreements.[^bornstein]

Collective action problems are notoriously difficult to solve.  In the case of intergroup conflict, compelling group members to sacrifice now for the long-term good of the group is made even more difficult because individuals may be killed before peace is achieved and thus never enjoy the benefits of collective action.  Individuals are notoriously bad even at saving for retirement, where individuals can sacrifice now to benefit themselves later [@benartzi2013behavioral; @warner2001personal].  Individuals may rationally discount future payoffs quite significantly in conflict settings where the benefits accrue to a group.

[^bornstein]: Bornstein (@bornstein1992free; @bornstein2003intergroup) was among the first to consider how the preferences of individuals complicate discussions of group conflict.  His focus, and the focus of most subsequent scholarship, was how groups encourage group members to participate in violence against the other side, since winning the fight benefits all group members but only group members who fight bear the costs.

@fearon1996explaining showed that ingroup policing, an institution wherein groups punish their own miscreants, can help groups avoid an escalation of intergroup violence; they credit the relative paucity of group conflict to such institutions.  Ingroup policing is an excellent institution for preventing violence from escalating and for maintaining peace in many contexts, but I suggest that perceptual biases and mistrust between groups in or with a recent history of conflict makes ingroup policing unsustainable as a solution in those contexts.  With ingroup policing, groups are restrained from overly lenient punishment of their own people by the threat of violence escalating if either group suspects the other of acting in bad faith.  Since ingroup policing depends on the perceptions group members, if those perceptions are biased such that members of each group suspect the other is trying to take advantage of the ingroup policing institution, then the institution breaks down as each group does not trust the other to allocate sufficient punishment to their own side.

Need to think about ways to reduce the biases that cause misperceptions and a modification of ingroup policing that should be less susceptible to misperceptions when they do occur.


## Joint-Punishment Institutions

Intergroup contact is not a panacea, however, and groups can still misperceive the behavior and intentions of the other side.  When both groups desire cooperation, the risk of cooperative behavior being misperceived as uncooperative behavior is the main threat to enduring peace [@jervis2017misperception; @wu1995cope; @bendor1991doubt].  If groups trust each other to police their own, each side must worry that the other group will not punish their own members with sufficient force to deter their harmful or discriminatory actions.  Groups are, after all, biased in favor of their own side.  Groups need a collaborative institutional structure to minimize misperceptions and their effect.


<!--8 - Mistakes happen; need to reduce chances for misinterpretation of other side's signals.  Joint-punishment apparatus. Not ingroup policing-->
Intergroup contact is a good first step to show groups that both benefit from cooperation and help groups send and receive signals of cooperation.  Even if contact reduces biases that cause misperceptions of these signals, however, misperceptions are still possible and can derail cooperative equilibria [@jervis2017misperception; @wu1995cope; @bendor1991doubt].  Members of one group may accidentally engage in action that harms the other or may perceive outgroup behavior as aggressive when it is not.  For long-term peace, institutions must minimize and manage these misperceptions.

One common mechanism for reducing group conflict is ingroup policing in which each side polices its own miscreants [@fearon1996explaining].  Ingroup policing is generally an excellent institution for preventing escalations of violence and for maintaining peace.  The research summarized in this paper, however, suggests that mistrust between groups in or with a recent history of conflict may make ingroup policing unsustainable as a solution to prevent violence because of the potential for one group to devalue the costs imposed by the ingroup on their defector.  Groups in conflict reactively devalue costly behaviors done by the other side [@ward1997naive; @ross1995psychological; @maoz2002reactive; @millard2018testing] on the logic that "$X$ behavior must not be very costly, since they were willing to do it" (@kahneman1992reference calls a similar phenomenon "concession aversion").  This reactive devaluation causes problems for ingroup policing, since it can create the perception that any ingroup punishment was too lenient.  This can cause the outgroup to exact their own punishment, which may be viewed as too harsh, causing a spiral of violence.  Instead of ingroup policing, perhaps misperceptions could be minimized by a peace agreement in which both groups are involved in the punishment of defectors who harm their outgorup.  The involvement of both groups minimizes the possibility that either side believes the punishment was too lenient or harsh.^[The ingroup could of course account for this bias and assign even harsher punishments to ingroup defectors, but those excessive punishments may reduce support for ingroup policing because group views the punishment as disproportionate to the crime.]

The possibility of ingroup policing being unsustainable due to misperceptions, and of the potential for joint-punishment institutions to reduce misperceptions, should be considered in future research.
