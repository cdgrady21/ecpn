VI: Avenues for Empirical Research

-	Test contact programs with groups in conflict and with history of conflict.  Look for collaborative institutions.

-	Compare contact programs that do and do not (1) work to achieve goal, (2) actually achieve it.

-	Best means to demonstrate material rationality of peace.  Trade, differentiated groups?

- Best means to reduce psych/cognitive biases

-	Need for enforcement at onset to incentivize Cooperation?

-	Role of elites: contact says they must support

-	Difficulty with very decentralized groups

-	Power disparities between groups

-	Contact’s differential effects with these power disparities.

- How to get things started?


# Avenues for Future Research

<!--Collective Action leads to commitment problems/lack of trust between groups.  There is a within-group Collective action problem in addition to a between-group commitment problem.  Groups made of individuals.  What does it mean to trust a group?  It means trusting that sufficient number of group members will cooperate and that they can and will compel other group members who do not want to cooperate.  Sambanis: “peace can be derailed by a few radicals.” Beyond most members of a group signaling a commitment to peace, they must also signal a willingness and capacity to punish ingroup members who do not contribute to peace.  -->

An additional challenge with building trust between groups has not received much attention in the literature: each group faces a within-group collective action problem in addition to the between-group commitment problem.  The collective action problem occurs because each group is a collection of individual group members with their own behavioral incentives, not cohesive entities.  Peace benefits all members of a group, but contributing to peace is costly for group members because they must refrain from engaging in behaviors that benefit themselves at the expense of the outgroup.  Achieving peace, as with any public good, requires overcoming this collective action problem: the group must compel group members to contribute to peace despite the members' individual incentive to shirk and rely on others to bear its cost.  <!--What does it mean for a group to trust another group?-->One group trusting the other to honor an agreement, then, means not only trusting that a high proportion of outgroup members desire peace, but also that those outgroup members can and will compel less cooperative group members to honor a peace agreement [@fearon1996explaining].  Peace, after all, can be derailed by a few radicals [@sambanis2013social; @de2009effects].

Implicitly identified by @fearon1996explaining.  Most literature about collective action problems in conflict concern each group's attempt to compel group members to _fight_ the other side, not each group's attempt to compel group members to _cooperate_ with the other side.

<!--8 - Mistakes happen; need to reduce chances for misinterpretation of other side's signals.  Joint-punishment apparatus. Not ingroup policing-->
Intergroup contact is a good first step to show groups that both benefit from cooperation and help groups send and receive signals of cooperation.  Even if contact reduces biases that cause misperceptions of these signals, however, misperceptions are still possible and can derail cooperative equilibria [@jervis2017misperception; @wu1995cope; @bendor1991doubt].  Members of one group may accidentally engage in action that harms the other or may perceive outgroup behavior as aggressive when it is not.  For long-term peace, institutions must minimize and manage these misperceptions.

One common mechanism for reducing group conflict is ingroup policing in which each side polices its own miscreants [@fearon1996explaining].  Ingroup policing is generally an excellent institution for preventing escalations of violence and for maintaining peace.  The research summarized in this paper, however, suggests that mistrust between groups in or with a recent history of conflict may make ingroup policing unsustainable as a solution to prevent violence because of the potential for one group to devalue the costs imposed by the ingroup on their defector.  Groups in conflict reactively devalue costly behaviors done by the other side [@ward1997naive; @ross1995psychological; @maoz2002reactive; @millard2018testing] on the logic that "$X$ behavior must not be very costly, since they were willing to do it" (@kahneman1992reference calls a similar phenomenon "concession aversion").  This reactive devaluation causes problems for ingroup policing, since it can create the perception that any ingroup punishment was too lenient.  This can cause the outgroup to exact their own punishment, which may be viewed as too harsh, causing a spiral of violence.  Instead of ingroup policing, perhaps misperceptions could be minimized by a peace agreement in which both groups are involved in the punishment of defectors who harm their outgorup.  The involvement of both groups minimizes the possibility that either side believes the punishment was too lenient or harsh.^[The ingroup could of course account for this bias and assign even harsher punishments to ingroup defectors, but those excessive punishments may reduce support for ingroup policing because group views the punishment as disproportionate to the crime.]

The possibility of ingroup policing being unsustainable due to misperceptions, and of the potential for joint-punishment institutions to reduce misperceptions, should be considered in future research.
