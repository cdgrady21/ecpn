IIIa: Intergroup contact to remove those factors
-	Make groups want peace: Goal achievement through cooperation: cooperation in each group’s interest
-	Give groups incentive to solve collective action problem: Norms for cooperation
-	Reduces psych biases to perception: removes stereotypes, anxiety/threat; adds empathy, identification of similarities/joint interests
-	Provides opportunity for costly signaling: groups interact and can directly observe outgroup’s preferences and behavior.  Confidence-building measure.
