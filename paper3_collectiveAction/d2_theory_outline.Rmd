IIIb: Joint punishment institutions to minimize misperceptions
-	Situation is an iterative Prisoner’s Dilemma: best off with [C,C] but really want to avoid [D,D]. Describe iterative PD.
-	When groups prefer peace and intend to cooperate, misperceptions/accidents main challenge to peace: Try to throw C, accidentally throw D.  OR Throw C, gets interpreted as D.
-	Collective action problem: societies heterogeneous, some don’t want peace.  A bad apple could throw D; C is then punishing your own.  Two levels of misperception: (1) that D was purposeful on part of group, and (2) that the punishment was not severe enough and the punishment C was actually a D.
-	Solution described (police your own) subject to misperceiving.
-	Social norms/institutions minimize “accidental” individual D.  Institutions to minimize misperception of C to D.
-	Joint punishment: both groups decide together.  Pros/cons.
