## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Context Outline

- distirbution of the lands: map that shows the regions: Fulani region, farmer region
- The setting: rural, economic
- the background: these populations used to get along, but population booms and climate change reduce land:people ratio
- The conflict: escalating, burnt village/livestock guard, expulsion


- groups first meet _separately_ to prepare them to be brought together.

- Some spillover due to site closeness, but this would only bias our estimated downwards.


## Context

While most attention to conflict in Nigeria focuses Boko Haram, persistent violence between farmers and pastoralists in Nigeriaâ€™s Middle Belt has contributed to more casualties (Fulton and Nickels, 2017) and costs the Nigerian economy $13 billion a year (MacDougal et al, 2015). 

Groups used to commit to collaboration -- sharing land, sharing manure, sharing crop residue, sharing food (meat for grains, vegetables).  But as situation changed groups could no longer commit.
