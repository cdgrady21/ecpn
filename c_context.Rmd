## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Context Outline

- distirbution of the lands: map that shows the regions: Fulani region, farmer region
- The setting: rural, economic
- The conflict: escalating, burnt village/livestock guard, expulsion


## Context

While most attention to conflict in Nigeria focuses Boko Haram, persistent violence between farmers and pastoralists in Nigeriaâ€™s Middle Belt has contributed to more casualties (Fulton and Nickels, 2017) and costs the Nigerian economy $13 billion a year (MacDougal et al, 2015).
