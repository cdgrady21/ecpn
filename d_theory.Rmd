## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Theory Outline

Some studies suggest that contact in these contexts might increase prejudice.   [Chris: Ryan Enos, Gubler, negative contact guy].  Can direct intergroup contact overcome conflict and economic factors to reduce prejudice in places most in need of prejudice reduction?
