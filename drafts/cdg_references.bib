  abstract      = {We develop a new method for blocking in randomized
		  experiments that works for an arbitrary number of
		  treatments. We analyze the following prob- lem: given a
		  threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained
		  in a block, and given a distance measure between any two
		  units in the finite population, block the units so that the
		  maximum distance between any two units within a block is
		  minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate
		  imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design.
		  Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem.
		  However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the
		  first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking
		  algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of
		  estimators for sample average treatment effects under the
		  Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary
		  blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.

		  This article tests the sorting model by paying strict heed

		  particular type (electoral activity), only when the
		  educational environment accounts for variation across age
		  and place, and only when one models the interactive
		  relationship between education at the individual and
		  environmental levels. Furthermore, sorting applies more to

Entertainment media offers a unique and cost-effective channel of reaching millions of viewers with financial education messages that resonate. This paper uses random and symmetric encouragement methodology to study the economic impact of targeted messages on debt management and gambling scripted in a popular television soap opera in South Africa. The results show treated viewers score significantly higher on financial knowledge, are more likely to borrow from formal sources and for productive purposes, and are less likely to enter into retail credit or gamble. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of mechanisms show strong recall of messages conveyed by the lead character, which supports theories of psychological and emotional influences on decision-making.

Depending on the condition, the decision rules were such that the proposition allegedly passed or failed. The degree of threat of the group was varied by informing participants that the group represented a small (4%) or substantial (40%) proportion of the population living in the area. Consistent with the Group Attribution Error literature, the outcome of the vote influenced participants’ inferences about the extremity of the voters’ attitude. More positive (negative) attitudes were inferred in the case of a positive (negative) outcome of the vote. This effect was qualified by the level of threat. Participants inferred relatively more extreme and more homogeneous attitudes among the members of a threatening group."},

problems in social cognitive science. Although no other
concept is invoked more frequently in the social
sciences, we still know little about how social norms
are formed, the forces determining their content, and
the cognitive and emotional requirements that enable a
species to establish and enforce social norms. In recent
years, there has been substantial progress, however, on
how cooperation norms are enforced. Here we review
evidence showing that sanctions are decisive for norm
enforcement, and that they are largely driven by nonselfish
motives. Moreover, the explicit study of sanctioning
behavior provides instruments for measuring
social norms and has also led to deeper insights
into the proximate and ultimate forces behind human
cooperation},

 show experimentally that there is indeed a wide
spread willingness of the cooperators to punish
 the free-riders. Our results indicate that this
 holds true even if punishment is costly and does
 not provide any material benefits for the pun
isher. In addition, we provide evidence that
 free-riders are punished the more heavily the
 more they deviate from the cooperation levels
 of the cooperators. Potential free-riders, there
fore, can avoid or at least reduce punishment by
 increasing their cooperation levels. This, in
 turn, suggests that in the presence of punish
ment opportunities there will be less free riding},

conformitychannel. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in urban Nigeria where
young viewers were exposed to Shuga or to a non-educational TV series. Among those
who watched Shuga, we created additional variation in the social messagesthey received
and in the people with whom they watched the show. We nd signicant improvements
in knowledge and attitudes towards HIV and risky sexual behavior. Treated subjects are
twice as likely to get tested for HIV 6 to 9 months after the intervention. We also nd
reductions in STDs among women. Our experimental manipulations of the social norm
component did not produce signicantly di¤erent results from the main treatment. Also,
we dont detect signicant spillovers on the behavior of friends who did not watch Shuga.
The informatione¤ect of edutainment thus seems to have prevailed in the context of our

  abstract  = {We contrast two theoretical approaches to social influence, one stressing interpersonal
dependence, conceptualized as normative and informational influence (Deutsch &
Gerard, 1955), and the other stressing group membership, conceptualized as selfcategorization
and referent informational influence (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher &
Wetherell, 1987). We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the
existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as
belonging to one's own category. This study tested these two approaches using three
influence paradigms. First we demonstrate that, in Sherifs (1936) autokinetic effect
paradigm, the impact of confederates on the formation of a norm decreases as their
membership of a different category is made more salient to subjects. Second, in the Asch
(1956) conformity paradigm, surveillance effectively exerrs normative pressure ifdone by
an in-group but not by an out-group. In-group influence decreases and out-group
influence increases when subjects respond privately. Self-report data indicate that
in-groupconfederates create more subjective uncertainty than out-group confederates and
public responding seems to increase cohesiveness with in-group - but decrease it with
out-group - sources of influence. In our third experiment we use the group polarization
paradigm (e.g. Bumstein & Vinokur, 1973) to demonstrate that, when categorical
differences between two subgroups within a discussion group are made salient, convergence
of opinion between the subgroups is inhibited. Taken together the experiments
show that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence},

All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.},

central to understanding media effects, what forms this dialogue, and how does it influence people

which examined an entertainment-education (E-E) programme in India, developed with the intention of
promoting pro-social change (e.g., gender equality, family planning, etc.). We discovered that internal
dialogue (parasocial interaction) between listeners and media characters lead to conversations about
the educational content of the media programme that fuelled support for social stability and for prosocial
change. Second, interpersonal dialogue within families, and dialogue at the group level among
community members, facilitated discussion of sensitive or taboo subjects in ways that were supportive
of social stability as well as social change in family and community dynamics. Finally, listeners and
viewers of E-E programmes confronted powerful forces of resistance as they attempted to change
community power dynamics. Despite these difficulties, our findings suggest that synergistic possibilities
for social action emerge when E-E broadcasts disseminate pro-social models of behaviour that spark
various forms of dialogue among audience members},

This article measures the program’s effectiveness based on a sample of 462 participants and 453 nonparticipants. The results show that the program was successful in producing changes in three of the underlying structural factors of HIV: gender attitudes, gender roles, and HIV stigma.

norm enforcement often emerge in the context of inter-group
conflicts13,14, they are likely to be shaped by parochialism15—a
preference for favouring the members of one’s ethnic, racial or
language group. We have conducted punishment experiments16,
which allow ‘impartial’ observers to punish norm violators, with
indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that these
experiments confirm the prediction of parochialism. We found
that punishers protect ingroup victims—who suffer from a norm
violation—much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless
of the norm violator’s group affiliation. Norm violators also expect
that punishers will be lenient if the latter belong to their social
group. As a consequence, norm violations occur more often if the
punisher and the norm violator belong to the same group. Our
results are puzzling for evolutionary multi-level selection theories
based on selective group extinction2–5 as well as for theories of
individual selection17–19; they also indicate the need to explicitly
examine the interactions between individuals stemming from

The simulation (vs. control lecture) produced significantly more intergroup perspective-taking, empathy, and favorable attitudes toward homosexuals and marginalized groups. Tests of a structural equation model supported the assumption that the simulation (vs. control) provided an experience that heightened intergroup perspective-taking, which indirectly predicted favorable attitudes via independent cognitive (inclusive intergroup representations) and affective (empathy) paths. The model held after statistically controlling for prior attitudes and ideological individual differences predicting anti-homosexual bias.

  abstract  = {Does social influence exerted through role modeling of collective action impact social change in contexts that are
not conducive to collective action, such as long-lasting violent conflicts?We examined this question in two field
experiments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We created two versions of an episode of an existing
media intervention (a show aiming to promote positive social change), in which fictional characters either
planned collective action (role modeling condition), or did not plan action (control condition) to address grievances.
In Study 1, role modeling affected individual-level outcomes: it increased perceived collective efficacy and
willingness to take action, but exacerbated intergroup attitudes and reduced tolerance. Study 2 tested the influence
of role modeling on a group-level outcome (group discussions). Discussions following the role modeling
show focused less on grievances, and included more positive lessons of the show, as well as more statements
about collective efficacy and collective action. The findings highlight the influence of role modeling of collective
action through media on efficacy and action for social change, but caution against unintended consequences on
intergroup attitudes.},

Ss were given a battery of attitudes indices and behavior measures, including the Koslin Social Distance Scale, the K-Z Test, the Friendship Questionnaire, and social distance, picture imitation, and discrimination tasks. Ss who were high in prejudice were randomly assigned to an experimental condition or a matched control group. Race of examiner was varied. Posttests were administered after 2 wks and again 4–6 mo later. Results reveal a significant short-term reduction in prejudice for all experimental groups on combined measures. Vicarious contact and perceptual approaches were more effective than the other 2 methods. Some interaction effects with grade and race of examiner were found. Long-term treatment effects were less pronounced, although some gains were maintained in the vicarious contact and perceptual differentiation groups.},

A pre-post-test intervention was conducted including three conditions: (a) cognitive intervention; (b) cognitive and behavioural intervention involving equal-status contact with the target group; (c) no-intervention control. The sample consisted of 70 ninth grade students. Following baseline assessments of attitudes, attitude change was measured immediately following the intervention and at a follow-up three months post-intervention. The cognitive intervention provided information about physical disability and challenged stereotypic conceptions about the physically disabled. The behavioural intervention consisted of engaging in three paralympic disciplines under the instruction of a group of disabled athletes. The cognitive intervention alone did not result in significant changes in attitudes towards the physically disabled. However, the combined cognitive-behavioural intervention resulted in greater attitude change than the no-intervention condition, both immediately post-intervention and at a three months follow-up. The findings are discussed with regard to models of attitude change through equal-status contact.},

Otherwise, access to positive legislative performance information actually lowered incumbent vote share.

  abstract  = {How can intergroup contact programs affect conflict-ridden communities besides improving the outgroup attitudes of participating individuals? We address this question by examining the effects of an intergroup contact intervention on ingroup dynamics that may mitigate intergroup conflict. We also examine how outgroup attitudes and psychological resources mediate such effects. We present the results from a difference-in-differences design with 149 Jewish and Arab-Palestinian youth, some of whom participated in an intergroup contact and sports program operated by a nongovernmental organizations in Israel. Our main outcome is one’s tendency to censure ingroup members’ provocations toward the outgroup. As expected, we find a positive impact of the program on ingroup censuring. However, this result is only marginally significant. We find a positive effect of program participation on outgroup attitudes among Jewish youth as expected. To our surprise, among Arab-Palestinian youth, we find a negative effect on outgroup attitudes. Exploring the underlying processes and group-based differences further, we find that outgroup regard mediates the effect of intergroup contact on ingroup censuring for Jewish youth. We find no evidence for mediation among Arab-Palestinian youth but a positive association between ingroup censuring and psychological resources. These results suggest that the psychological conditions of ingroup censuring may differ by group. We discuss implications for peace-building interventions in societies with groups in conflict.},

  abstract  = {How might interventions that engage ordinary citizens in settings of violent conflict
affect broader conflict dynamics? Given the volume of resources committed
every year to citizen-oriented programs that attempt to promote peace, this is
an important question. We develop a framework to analyze processes through
which individual-level interventions could mitigate violent conflict escalation
more broadly. Individual-level interventions may increase positive feelings toward
the outgroup, as well as psychological, social, and material resources among participants.
These have the potential to influence behaviors such as policing of the
ingroup, public advocacy, and political action that can contribute to peace. Yet, the
effectiveness of interventions to influence the conflict is moderated by contextual
factors like groups’ access to material resources, their positions in society, and
political institutions. We use this analytical framework to assess evidence from
recent intervention studies. We find that the current evidence base is quite small,
does not cover the diversity of relevant contexts, and gives too little attention
to resources and capacities that enable people to engage in conflict mitigation
behaviors. Researchers and policy makers should go beyond thinking only about 
improving attitudes to thinking about behavior, resources, and capacities for such
behaviors, and contextual conditions that constrain behavior.},
