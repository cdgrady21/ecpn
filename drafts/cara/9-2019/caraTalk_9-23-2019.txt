Paper purpose
- could see one paper if you have a theoretical argument and you have an application here.
- probably two papers because these literatures never talk to each other
- would it hurt paper to take out all the bargaining stuff?
- bury the point of it: page 3 is where you mention the contact stuff.
	- if it's only a contact paper.

If a paper about how these literatures can help each other, can be written irrespective of actual experiment.
- in paper, the example does not make this that helpful.
- bargaining people: 3rd party or develop trustworthy reputations
- this is a 3rd party.  why did anyone trust them?
	- why is this intervention a way to help us understand bargaining failure?
- if bring in bargaining failure, need to explain more how this is a bargaining failure?  What about the 3rd party being involved?
	- **chris**: the 3rd party does not "punish" fighting.  Rewards of the program not dependent on not fighting, just dependent on some members of each community getting in room together.

Need to bring them together more.  Right now it's a section on bargaining failure, and then a section on psych/contact.
- what do psych people gain from reading Fearon?

EASY
- write a contact experiment in novel setting: application of contact in violent setting.
- second paper is how to bring contact theory and bargaining together.
If write this as one, more "I can help you, you can help us" kind of thing.
- need to explain how they help each other more.
	- after "This is an IR problem, this is a contact problem"
	- how does bargaining change what you would do?  **chris**: It's all about trust.
	- psych modeling the development of trust: 
	- psych people: thinking about conflict as a bargaining problem
	- IR people: Conflict is a trust problem, here's what the psych people know about trust.  Here's how it affects the bargaining model.  

Outside of artificial groups, why does it work or not?
- history?  no theories talk about history of the groups and what that does.  longevity? violence? level of animosity? Stereotypes vs THEY KILLED MY FAMILY.
- less heavy-handed interaction?

Contact theory and minority feelings.  
diversity.  30 people needed to move bus, and have 30 white kids vs 15 white kids and 15 black kids.  what does the diversity add?
- conflict: both groups really needed.  dynamics of bargaining situation changes a lot of I'm china and your malta vs china and the US.
	- you could ignore the other side.

abstract too long.
