\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Intergroup conflict is responsible for many of the worst displays of
human nature. In Nigeria, intergroup conflict between farmers and
pastoralists has claimed countless lives and destroyed countless
communities over the past two decades. As the conflict escalated, groups
of anti-pastoralist vigilantes mobilized to pre-emptively prevent
pastoralists from encroaching on land claimed by farmers (Duru 2018;
McDonnel 2017). These groups, dubbed the ``livestock guard'', ransacked
pastoralist settlements and violently drove pastoralists from their
homes, often with the assistance of the local farming community.
Likewise, pastoralist groups enacted vigilante justice, raiding and
burning down farming villages seen to encroach on land claimed by
pastoralists. Attacks such as these forced up to 180,000 people from
their homes in 2018 (Daniel 2018) and farmer-pastoralist conflict costs
Nigeria \$13 billion of lost economic productivity annually (McDougal et
al. 2015).

Though farmer-pastoralist conflict was widespread, mass violence did not
break out between these groups in all conflicting communities. In one
village, farmers and pastoralists defended each other from hostile
neighbors. When a group of livestock guard came for one pastoralist
settlement, the neighboring farming village arrested them to protect the
pastoralists. After the arrest, farmers and pastoralists convened to
decide what should be done with the prisoners. They agreed that the
group of livestock guard should not be punished, but should be disarmed
and released home -- a proposition proposed by \emph{the pastoralists}.
These farmers and pastoralists had also struggled with conflict, and
people on both sides had died in disputes over farmland and grazing
land. But their disputes had not escalated to the point that each side
wanted the other removed by any means necessary. They had created
structures that allowed them to settle disputes, and the same structures
allowed them to reach a solution about the livestock guard.

Why were some farmer and pastoralist groups able to keep peace whereas
others were swallowed by the escalating conflict? Why were some
communities able to overcome their intergroup disputes whereas others
were destroyed by them? These questions are not unique to Nigeria, and
understanding the factors that help groups resolve their disputes is
important for mitigating and preventing the myriad intergroup conflicts
around the world. Intergroup conflict fuels and is fueled by intergroup
prejudice. Using the framework of intergroup conflict as a bargaining
failure, we argue that psychological reconciliation during an ongoing
conflict can increase intergroup trust and reduce intergroup conflict.
Peacebuilding programs can help conflicting groups achieve psychological
reconciliation through intergroup contact and superordinate goals
(Sherif 1958).

Intergroup conflict is often conceptualized as a bargaining problem
(Fearon 1994; Powell 2006). Both groups want some resource -- land,
power, etc -- and must decide how to distribute that resource. Groups
can either bargain and split the resource, or groups can fight to claim
all of the resource or to increase their bargaining position later.
Fighting is costly, so both groups are better off finding a bargained
solution than fighting. However, bargaining fails if neither group
trusts the other side to be truthful or to honor bargained agreements
(A. Kydd 2000; Rohner, Thoenig, and Zilibotti 2013, 2013). Without a
reason to trust in the other side, groups are likely to remain in
conflict.

How can groups in conflict build trust and avoid this spiral of
distrust? The classic answer is Hobbes' Leviathan, a strong external
actor that punishes defection from bargained agreements (Doyle and
Sambanis 2000; Fearon 1994; Ostrom and Walker 2003; Powell 2006). If a
strong external actor punishes groups for defecting, each side can trust
the other to abide by their agreement because abiding by their agreement
is in each group's self-interest. A strong external actor serves as a
substitute for the trust the groups lack.

But external actors punishing defection are not desirable or possible
everywhere. Intervening as an external actors is costly, and often there
are no external actors strong enough or interested enough to intervene
(Fey and Ramsay 2010; A. H. Kydd 2006). Often the conflicting groups are
not united and therefore it is not clear who is involved in bargaining
and who the external actor should punish if one side defects. Where an
external actor is available, it is a short-term peace solution and its
effects do not endure with the external actor's departure (Beardsley
2008; Rohner, Thoenig, and Zilibotti 2013; Weinstein 2005). In fact,
external actor can make it more difficult to create social norms that
sustain peace long-term (Frey 1994; Ostrom 2000; Rohner, Thoenig, and
Zilibotti 2013). With or without external actors to halt the conflict,
the groups must eventually build trust rather than find a substitute for
trust.

Increasing trust amidst conflict is difficult, however. Group conflicts
are often driven and perpetuated by intergroup animosity and prejudice
long after the original grievance is forgotten {[}McDonnel (2017); cite
more about intergroup conflict \& intergroup prejudice{]}. Intergroup
animosity and intergroup prejudice can be insurmountable barriers to
peace. Prejudice prevents peace for direct and indirect reasons.
Directly, highly prejudiced groups are less likely to trust information
they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from
the other side. In this way, prejudice directly inhibits intergroup
bargaining and prevents peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Indirectly, prejudice biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup
behavior, preventing each group from updating and improving their
attitudes about the other. Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent
actions as defensive and justified, whereas behavior by outgroup members
may be perceived as more threatening and more malicious than the same
behavior committed by a neutral party {[}Hewstone (1990); cite
fundamental/ultimate attribution error, motivated reasoning,
confirmation bias, anchoring bias{]}. The perceived negative behavior
may be seen as \emph{defining} of the group, whereas any perceived
positive behavior may be seen as the \emph{exception} to the group
(Allison and Messick 1985; Pettigrew 1979). This biased information
processing reinforces negative group stereotypes and can subvert the
groups' own attempts to foster peace. It can also sabotage intergroup
bargaining by causing the groups to have inaccurate beliefs about each
other and each other's willingness to make peace, adding to information
and commitment problems that cause conflict.

In states of high prejudice, groups are essentially locked into a
mutually-defecting Prisoner's Dilemma because each side assumes the
other will defect, even if one side cooperated first. Strategies that
help reduce group prejudice could help the groups achieve peace.
Reducing prejudice makes increasing intergroup trust possible.
Intergroup trust ameliorates bargaining problems and increases the
likelihood of the groups solving disputes through bargaining instead of
violence. Reducing prejudice is valuable with or without a strong
external actor to punish defection because the strong external actor
cannot police the groups indefinitely. Eventually, the groups must trust
each other even in the absence of costs for defection.

One approach to reducing intergroup prejudice comes from intergroup
contact theory. Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions
in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will reduce
prejudice and the likelihood of violence. Intergroup contact works by
demystifying the outgroup, presenting the other group's perspective, and
replacing imagined stereotypes with firsthand knowledge (Allport 1954;
Pettigrew and Tropp 2008). This type of structured face-to-face contact
also provides groups the opportunity to send costly signals about their
willingness to cooperate (A. Kydd 2000; Lupia, McCubbins, and Arthur
1998), helping each group update its opinion of the other side's
preference for peace. Intergroup contact is likely especially good at
reducing intergroup conflict when groups cooperate to achieve
superordinate goals -- goals that require the cooperation of both groups
and benefit both groups -- because groups experience the material
benefits of cooperation (Gaertner et al. 2000; Sherif 1958).

The prejudice-reducing effects of intergroup contact have been
demonstrated in a variety of countries and using a variety of
methodological approaches (Paluck, Green, and Green 2017; Pettigrew and
Tropp 2006). Notably, intergroup contacted programs reduced prejudice
between white people and black people in the U.S. and South Africa
(Burns, Corno, and La Ferrara 2015; Marmaros and Sacerdote 2006), Jews
and Arabs (Ditlmann and Samii 2016; Yablon 2012), and Hindus and Muslims
(Barnhardt 2009). Peacebuilding programs utilizing intergroup contact
and superordinate goals are increasingly used to reduce intergroup
conflict by peacebuilding organizations (Ditlmann, Samii, and Zeitzoff
2017).

Although research shows support for intergroup contact theory generally,
its efficacy to reduce prejudice amid real-world conflict is an open
question. First, most research about intergroup contact uses
correlational studies or lab experiments, both of which have
methodological weaknesses. Correlational studies cannot demonstrate
causal effects, and results from lab experiments may not apply to real
world conflicts, where groups compete for resources and share a history
of intergroup violence (Ditlmann, Samii, and Zeitzoff 2017). Second, no
prior studies of intergroup contact have involved groups engaged in
active intergroup violence\footnote{Previous studies have involved
  groups with a history of violent conflict but not groups involved in
  an active conflict. See Scacco and Warren (2018) and Ditlmann and
  Samii (2016) for examples.}, and some studies suggest that intergroup
contact in violent settings could be ineffective or even backfire.
Negative experiences with outgroups increase prejudice, and the most
prejudiced individuals are most likely to interpret intergroup contact
negatively (Gubler 2013; Paolini, Harwood, and Rubin 2010). Despite a
lack of evidence about the effects of contact-based peacebuilding
programs in violent contexts, and the risks of programs going badly,
peacebuilding organizations implement numerous contact-based
interventions in violent contexts each year. These peacebuilding
programs might defuse intergroup conflict, but these programs also might
do more harm than good.

To study the effect of bottom-up psychological interventions on violent
conflict, we conduct a field experiment with farmer and pastoralist
communities in Nigeria to determine if an intergroup contact-based
program effectively increases intergroup trust and increases the
physical security of group members. We randomly assigned communities
with farmer-pastoralist violence to receive the peacebuilding
intervention or serve as a control group. The intervention formed
mixed-group committees and provided them with funds to build
infrastructure that would benefit both communities; committees then
collaboratively chose and constructed infrastructure projects.\footnote{The
  communities built boreholes, market stalls, primary health care
  facilities, etc.} The program also provided mediation training to each
community's leaders. To measure the effects of the intervention, we
conducted pre- and post-intervention surveys, a post-intervention
natural public goods behavioral game,\footnote{In a public goods game
  (PGG), research subjects are given money and told they can keep the
  money or donate it to a public fund. Money donated to the public fund
  is multiplied by some amount and then shared with all subjects. Our
  PGG is \emph{natural} because it was conducted in a natural setting,
  rather than a lab. The funding for the PGG came from the National
  Science Foundation under Grant No. 1656871.} and twelve months of
systematic observations in markets and social events during the
intervention.

We find that the program increased trust between groups and decreased
perceptions of physical insecurity. Compared to the control group, the
treatment group expressed more outgroup trust and more willingness to
interact with outgroup members. The treatment group was also less
prevented by violence from engaging in routine tasks, such as working,
going to the market, and getting water. The results also suggests that
intergroup contact for a relatively small percentage of a group can
indirectly affect attitudes of group members with no exogenous increase
in contact with the outgroup. We observe the most positive changes from
individuals directly involved in the intergroup committees, but we also
observe positive spillover to group members who were not involved in the
intergroup contact intervention.

This study expands our knowledge about intergroup conflict in several
ways. First, this study teaches us about the capacity of
psychologically-based peacebuilding programs to improve intergroup
relations. To our knowledge this is the first field experimental test of
a psychologically-based peacebuilding program implemented during an
active conflict. We evaluated the program's effects on both attitudinal
and behavioral outcomes. The results suggest that bottom-up
psychologically-based peacebuilding programs can effectively reduce
conflict and is especially relevant to conflict resolution in the cases
of intergroup and intercommunal conflicts.

Second, this study is one of the only field experimental interventions
to test intergroup contact theory with groups actively engaged in
violence. Each of the groups in our study were part of an active and
escalating conflict, with members of each side being killed within one
year of the intervention's onset. Even in such a context, community
members who engaged in direct interpersonal interaction with an outgroup
member changed more positively than other community members.
Importantly, the intergroup contact involved achieving superordinate
goals that benefited both groups materially. This suggests that contact
with superordinate goals is robust to actively violent contexts.

Third, we contribute to the literature about the role of social
diffusion and social institutions in shaping attitudes and behaviors.
Bottom-up peacebuilding interventions seek to provide a structure in
which groups can solve their own conflicts, and those structures are
social rather than coercive. Understanding how those structures form and
are maintained is relevant to other institutional setups attempting to
influence behavior. In this study, though the greatest changes in
attitudes and behaviors were from individuals directly interacting with
outgroup members, the attitudes of other community members also
improved. This type of ``social effect'' is also a potential way to
``scale up'' the effects of intergroup contact.

Fourth, this paper's focus on farmer-pastoralist conflict is especially
important because the pastoralists are of the Fulani ethnic group. The
Fulani are the largest semi-nomadic people on Earth, but their way of
life makes them targets for violence throughout Africa. Along with this
conflict in Nigeria, Fulani in Mali have been the targets of violence so
severe that researchers at Armed Conflict Location \& Event Data Project
called it ``ethnic cleansing'' (Economist 2019). Understanding how to
prevent conflict between Fulani and settled peoples can help prevent the
eradication of a people and their way of life.

In the next section we provide a theoretical framework for how and why
bottom-up interventions that focus on prejudice reduction can reduce
intergroup violence. We then discuss Nigeria's farmer-pastoralist
conflict, our experimental intervention, and two designs to evaluate the
effect of the intervention. Last we present the results of the study and
conclude by connecting these findings to theories of group conflict and
prejudice.
