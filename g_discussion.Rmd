## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Discussion Outline

Could be social desirability bias.  Would indicate the program changed social norms -- still valuable.

Could be survey acquescence bias -- randomization exp "yes" up on all topics.  But other "placebo" outcomes don't go up.

More research needed about using intergroup contact to promote peace between people in conflict.
