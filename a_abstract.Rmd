## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed and amidst escalating conflict.
- Intergroup contact helps increase trust and help groups overcome bargaining/comittment problems
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

Title: get the big picture stuff about "peace amidst conflict", get the IR conflict people with the word conflict, get the psych people with the word "intergroup contact", get experimental methods people with "field experiment", get Africanists with "Nigeria".

## Abstract

Can intergroup contact contribute to peace between groups involved in violent conflict?  Do these effects diffuse to ingroup members with no direct intergroup contact?  Rationalist perspectives on conflict would answer "no" on both counts -- intergroup contact does nothing to change the underlying strategic environment that causes conflict or prejudice.  Psychological perspectives would answer "yes" -- intergroup contact can increase trust and reduce conflict, and ingroup members without direct contact can learn vicariously from ingroup members with contact<!--Chris: work on this? -->.  Voluminous literatures on intergroup prejudice and intergroup violence fail to adjudicate between these perspectives because few if any studies of intergroup contact test the theory in the context of active violence.  Despite the lack of evidence that intergroup contact can reduce violent conflict, peacebuilding organizations often implement interventions inspired by intergroup contact in precisely these settings.^[cite:mercy corps, search for common ground, others?]  We answer these questions by conducting a field experiment with 30 communities in Nigeria, where farmers and pastoralists are embroiled in a deadly conflict over land use.  We find that a yearlong intergroup contact intervention for a small subset of community members reduces prejudice and increases perceptions of physical security, even for community members not directly involved in the intervention.  This experiment demonstrates the efficacy of intergroup contact to promote tolerance and peace between groups in conflict.

# Scacco abstract
Can positive social contact between members of antagonistic groups reduce prejudice and discrimination? Despite extensive research on social contact, observational studies are difficult to interpret because prejudiced people may select out of contact with out-group members. We overcome this problem by conducting an education-based, randomized field experiment—the Urban Youth Vocational Training program (UYVT)—with 849 randomly sampled Christian and Muslim young men in riot-prone Kaduna, Nigeria. After sixteen weeks of positive intergroup social contact, we find no changes in prejudice, but heterogeneous-class subjects discriminate significantly less against out-group members than subjects in homogeneous classes.  We trace this finding to increased discrimination by homogeneous-class subjects compared to non-UYVT study participants, and we highlight potentially negative consequences of in-group social contact. By focusing on skill-building instead of peace messaging, our intervention minimizes reporting bias and offers strong experimental evidence that intergroup social contact can alter behavior in constructive ways, even amid violent conflict.

# Enos abstract
The effect of intergroup contact has long been a question central to social scientists. As
political and technological changes bring increased interstate immigration, understanding
intergroup contact and demographic change is increasingly important to policy and scientifc
debates. Unfortunately, limitations in causal inference with observational data and the
practical inability to experiment on demographic context have constrained scholars' ability to
speak to the effects of intergroup contact. Here I report the results of an experiment testing
the causal effects of prolonged intergroup contact in which Spanish-speaking confederates
were randomly assigned to be inserted, for an extended period, into the daily routines of
unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus
simulating the conditions of demographic change. The result of this controlled experiment
is a signifcant shift toward exclusionary attitudes among treated subjects. However there is
evidence that the initial aversion diminishes over time. This experiment demonstrates that
even very minor demographic change causes strong exclusionary reactions.
