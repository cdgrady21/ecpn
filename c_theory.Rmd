# Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.



# Theory Outline (12-20 para)

### Optimist Camp: 5 para

Intergroup contact.  Realistic group conflict theory (functional interdepence between groups to reduce conflict.  Achieve a series of superordinate goals that neither group can achieve alone).



### Pessimist Camp: 5 para

This is a comittment problem.  Neither group can commit to cooperating, and each group only wants to cooperate if the other cooperates.  Solution is to impose high cost for defecting, usually through some third actor.


### Synthesize: 4 para

Comittment problem is a trust problem.  Interventions that increase intergroup trust should ameliorate comittment problems.

Trust can increase a two ways.  Group _leaders_ increase trust that the leader will punish defecting ingroup members.  Group members increase trust that outgroup members will not defect.  Not distinguishing between those ways and probably not mutually exclusive.

^[Simplest way to think about the problem in game-theoretic terms: one player & one stage game where P1 can cooperate or defect.  P1 has a belief about the type of P2; P2 has some probability of being a complier, conditional complier, or defector.  P1s payoffs for c/d depend on P2 type.  And the intervention increases P1's belief that P2 is conditional complier.  More complicated way is akin to Fearon's comittment problem.  Maybe has P2 signal its type to P1.  Intergroup contact allows for strong signal to P1.]

Negative contact increases prejudice more than positive contact decreases prejudice [@barlow2012contact]


# Notes

### General

Many conflict scholars see intergroup conflict as a bargaining game.  Conflict occurs because of a bargaining failure -- incorrect information [chris:cite], lack of trust that other group will honor comittments [@fearon; @powell].  The solution is a 3rd party -- another group, the state, social institutions like laws and customs -- powerful enough to compel both sides to honor their comittments.  Contracts & law are ways we can trust people without knowing them.  Large costs to defecting on our agreements help everyone trust that agreements will be kept.

But 3rd parties of this sort are not always possible.  Sometimes no state is strong enough to project power onto the conflicting groups.  Projecting power is expensive.  But groups do not necessarily need coercion to solve collective action problems.   Groups can develop social norms that constrain behavior, which are often more efficient than coercive appartus [@ostrom2015governing; @Ostrom2000evolution].  But sometimes social norms to solve conflict are not present or have broken down.

Intergroup contact is a solution to intergroup conflict from the psychological perspective.  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will reduce prejudice and the likelihood of violence by demystifying the outgroup, presenting the other group's perspective, and replacing imagined stereotypes with firsthand knowledge [@allport1954; @pettigrew2008does].  

Ostrom: grassroots norms. "a social norm, especially in a setting where there is communication between the parties, can work as well or nearly as well at generating cooperative behavior as an externally imposed set of rules and system of monitoring and sanctioning" [@ostrom2000evolution]

Comittment problems are trust problems: "the choice is not to trust, because the expectation is that the other player will not trust" [@ostrom2000evoluation]"

Ostrom on communication: "By devising simple, local mechanisms to get conflicts aired immediately and resolutions that are generally known in the community, the
number of conflicts that reduce trust can be reduced." [@ostrom2000evoluation]

Intergroup contact creates social institutions that affect/constrain behavior.

**It could convince the groups that cooperation is good**
Changing the game: [c,c] payoffs higher than [c,d or d,d] payoffs.  Before contact, could get social benefits to defecting and social costs to cooperating, so cooperating was not in anyone's interest.  After contact, social benefits from cooperating and social costs to defecting. Or something like that.

** It could convince the groups that the other side will cooperate**
Allows costly signaling that my groups type is conditional complier, not defector.  Increases trust that other group will cooperate.  Increase opportunities for group reputations to increase.  In game theory terms, direct reciprocity.

**It could increase the acceptable bargaining space**
Before, both groups would only accept agreements where they got 75% or more, so there was no agreement space.
This is more a story about perceived strength: why would I only accept bargaining where I would receive 75%+ if I thought the alternative to bargaining was you beating me and taking 100%?

**Alternative Mechanisms of Intergroup Contact**
Generalized trust -- no increase to "people of other religions/ethnicities"
Decreased threat -- nope
Ingroup increases to include other group -- intergroup cohesion does not seem to increase.  Probably not that ingroup norms being extended to outgroup.
incresed empathy -- no questions address this, or intergroup cohesion 2?
Perceived benefits of cooperation -- maybe?  But contact does not increase this.


### Pessimist Camp

Some studies suggest that contact in these contexts might increase prejudice.   [Chris: Ryan Enos, Gubler, negative contact guy, Devine et al 2002, Devine 1989, Fiske 1989, Bhavnani et al 2014 is like Gubler, other Scacco theory citations].  Can direct intergroup contact overcome conflict and economic factors to reduce prejudice in places most in need of prejudice reduction?


### Optimist Camp

A notable exception is the @Scacco2016 study in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact.  That study also showed null effects for intergroup contact but negative effects for intragroup contact.  That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and the intervention sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

Allport thought behavioral consequence of prejudice was group violence.

From Scacco: "these interventions are driven by the premise that macrolevel peace and stability can be built from the ground up (CÃ¡rdenas 2013; Kuriansky 2007; Gasser and Levinsen 2004;Maoz 2000)."

### General

Gaunt et al - Motivated Reasoning and the Attribution of Emotions to Ingroup and Outgroup
Dhont et al - https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/76f8/74c6fcc7067332f42ef4848f5878a184c152.pdf

Sidanius and Pratto 1999/2001 - social dominance theory

Violence requires justifying why the violence was okay.  Strong motivation to maintain negative attitudes.


We also want effects of intergroup contact for some ingroup members to diffuse to other ingroup members who have no contact.  The most prejudiced individuals will probably avoid contact, but if effects of contact from other ingroup members diffuse to these very prejudiced individuals -- either through vicarious/imagined contact or through social norm transmission -- intergroup contact could reduce prejudice even for individuals who do not engage in intergroup contact.


## Me

Bridging psychological and rationalist theories: still fundamentally a comittment problem.  But need to increase intergroup trust (belief that group will committ to agreement) and reduce intergroup prejudice (psychological benefit I get from hating the outgroup/feeling superior -- makes cost of conflict lower because adds some psychological benefit to conflict).  Strategic situation equation needs to adjust for psychological variables like trust and prejudice.

Overcoming comittment problem: Community leader involvement is very important -- leaders are often the ones bargaining, _and_ each side may trust that the other groups leaders can prevent/punish defections from his group.  Ingroup Policing.

Costly Signals

Penalties for Lying.
