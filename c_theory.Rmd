## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.



## Theory Outline (12-20 para)

### Optimist Camp: 5 para

Intergroup contact.  Realistic group conflict theory (functional interdepence between groups to reduce conflict.  Achieve a series of superordinate goals that neither group can achieve alone).



### Pessimist Camp: 5 para

This is a comittment problem.  Neither group can commit to cooperating, and each group only wants to cooperate if the other cooperates.  Solution is to impose high cost for defecting, usually through some third actor.


### Synthesize: 4 para

Comittment problem is a trust problem.  Interventions that increase intergroup trust should ameliorate comittment problems.

Trust can increase a two ways.  Group _leaders_ increase trust that the leader will punish defecting ingroup members.  Group members increase trust that outgroup members will not defect.  Not distinguishing between those ways and probably not mutually exclusive.

^[Simplest way to think about the problem in game-theoretic terms: one player & one stage game where P1 can cooperate or defect.  P1 has a belief about the type of P2; P2 has some probability of being a complier, conditional complier, or defector.  P1s payoffs for c/d depend on P2 type.  And the intervention increases P1's belief that P2 is conditional complier.  More complicated way is akin to Fearon's comittment problem.  Maybe has P2 signal its type to P1.  Intergroup contact allows for strong signal to P1.]

Negative contact increases prejudice more than positive contact decreases prejudice [@barlow2012contact]


## Notes

### Pessimist Camp

Some studies suggest that contact in these contexts might increase prejudice.   [Chris: Ryan Enos, Gubler, negative contact guy, Devine et al 2002, Devine 1989, Fiske 1989, Bhavnani et al 2014 is like Gubler, other Scacco theory citations].  Can direct intergroup contact overcome conflict and economic factors to reduce prejudice in places most in need of prejudice reduction?


### Optimist Camp

A notable exception is the @Scacco2016 study in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact.  That study also showed null effects for intergroup contact but negative effects for intragroup contact.  That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and the intervention sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

Allport thought behavioral consequence of prejudice was group violence.

From Scacco: "these interventions are driven by the premise that macrolevel peace and stability can be built from the ground up (CÃ¡rdenas 2013; Kuriansky 2007; Gasser and Levinsen 2004;Maoz 2000)."

### General

Gaunt et al - Motivated Reasoning and the Attribution of Emotions to Ingroup and Outgroup
Dhont et al - https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/76f8/74c6fcc7067332f42ef4848f5878a184c152.pdf

Sidanius and Pratto 1999/2001 - social dominance theory

Violence requires justifying why the violence was okay.  Strong motivation to maintain negative attitudes.


We also want effects of intergroup contact for some ingroup members to diffuse to other ingroup members who have no contact.  The most prejudiced individuals will probably avoid contact, but if effects of contact from other ingroup members diffuse to these very prejudiced individuals -- either through vicarious/imagined contact or through social norm transmission -- intergroup contact could reduce prejudice even for individuals who do not engage in intergroup contact.


## Me

Bridging psychological and rationalist theories: still fundamentally a comittment problem.  But need to increase intergroup trust (belief that group will committ to agreement) and reduce intergroup prejudice (psychological benefit I get from hating the outgroup/feeling superior -- makes cost of conflict lower because adds some psychological benefit to conflict).  Strategic situation equation needs to adjust for psychological variables like trust and prejudice.

Overcoming comittment problem: Community leader involvement is very important -- leaders are often the ones bargaining, _and_ each side may trust that the other groups leaders can prevent/punish defections from his group.  Ingroup Policing.
