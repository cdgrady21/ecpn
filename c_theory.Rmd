## Intergroup Conflict as a Bargaining Problem
<!--Typical solutions strive to solve intergroup bargaining problem.  Information and comittment problems.  Define these problems.  Strong 3rd parties solve comittments problems by adding large costs to defecting on agreements.  Mediation works when it solves the information problem.  Bigger versions of "Intergroup conflict is often conceptualized as a bargaining problem" and "How can groups in conflict escape this spiral of distrust and conflict?" paragraphs from intro.-->

Intergroup conflict is most often conceptualized as a bargaining problem [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war], and most solutions to reducing intergroup conflict strive to help the groups overcome those bargaining problems [@di2017effectiveness; chris: this cite is just for peacekeeping/intervention].  Intergroup conflict is a bargaining problem because both groups want some resource -- land, power, etc -- but cannot reach an agreement about how to distribute that resource peacefully.  Because fighting is costly, the groups are better off reaching a bargained compromise and not fighting.  However, two bargaining problems prevent this: information problems and commitment problems.  To successfully bargain, the groups need (1) accurate information about each other's strengths and preferences, and/or (2) the assurance that each side will abide by its agreements.  

An _information problem_ arises because neither group possesses accurate information about the other, and both groups have an incentive to deceive the other in order to achieve an advantageous bargaining outcome.  Groups have an incentive to portray themselves as stronger, more willing to fight, and less willing to make concessions than they truly are [@fearon1995rationalist]. This causes bargaining failures because neither group knows what agreements the other side is willing to accept or what their side should receive from bargaining.  A _commitment problem_ arises because neither group can credibly commit to honor bargained agreements if bargaining power shifts in the future.  If bargaining power shifts, one side will have an incentive to renege on the status quo agreement to achieve a better agreement.  Neither group can commit to honor agreements made today when both groups know that bargaining power may shift tomorrow.[^bargainChange]  Without the ability to commit to agreements, bargaining will not be successful.

[^bargainChange]: Power between the groups can shift due to factors that affect each group's preferences and capabilities. Internally, one group may grow in power or size, one group may disarm before the other, the groups may have factions that reject the agreement, the groups may change leaders, or group members attitudes may change for other reasons.  Externally, the groups may gain or lose de facto or de jure state support, other external actors may switch allegiances, or some other shock may change each group's power relative to the other [@fearon2004civil; @reed2016bargaining; chris: need to cite and add more].  Anything that will change group power in the future can cause commitment problems in the present.

Groups in conflict overcome these bargaining problems in several ways.  Groups can overcome information problems through fighting, as they learn about each others capacity and willingness to fight [@smith2003mediation].  Groups can also overcome information problems through mediation.  An interested third party mediator with no stake in the conflict can provide accurate information to both sides, helping each side reach a bargain [@ott1972mediation; @kydd2006can; @beber2012international] <!--mediators also prevent groups from saying inflammatory things to each other [chris: forgot cite] -->  Even if groups overcome information problems, commitment problems could prevent groups from reaching an agreement.  The main way that groups overcome commitment problems is through strong third parties that add large costs to reneging on agreements [@fearon1998commitment; @powell2006war; @doyle2000international].  Though each group may have an incentive to defect on its agreement if bargaining power changes in a vacuum, the groups have no incentive to defect if a strong third party is capable of and willing to punish defection from bargained agreements.  With a third party punishing defection, the groups can bargain in good faith knowing that the other will abide by its word.

<!--still left out: "In many conflicts, the conflicting groups are not united and therefore it is not clear who is involved in bargaining and who the external actor should punish if one side defects."-->

If we know how to resolve intergroup conflict, why does conflict persist?  International mediation and intervention are dogged by two issues of motivation.  First, mediators are often motivated for peace.  This motivation implies that mediator's provide information that is biased towards encouraging the groups to negotiate a peace agreement.  This means that peace-biased mediators do not solve information problems.  For mediators to reduce information problems, groups engaged in bargaining must believe that mediators provide accurate, unbiased information.  Since both groups know that mediators are biased towards peace, mediators may not help groups achieve peace [@smith2003mediation; @kydd2006can; @fey2010shuttle].  This same argument prevents mediators who are biased for or against disputants from solving information problems [@kydd2006can].[^mediation]

[^mediation]: Whether mediation is benefited from biased or unbiased information is still a matter of debate.  Some scholars believe bias improves mediation.  The primary mechanisms proposed are that biased mediators are more likely to have relevant private information [@savun2008information] and that a biased mediator who tells his _favored_ group to compromise will be heeded [@kydd2003side; @svensson2009brings].  We tend to side with @beber2012international, @rauchhaus2006mediation, @crescenzi2011supply, and @kydd2006can and believe that unbiased mediation improves mediation outcomes.  @kydd2006can and @beber2012international provide compelling theoretical arguments: effective mediators must be both unbiased and motivated, but that motivation and bias often overlap.  We are also amenable to the argument of @fey2010shuttle that mediator success actually has less to do with information provision and more with agenda setting, offering carrots/threatening sticks, and serving as a back channel.

Second, international actors may lack the motivation to mediate or to intervene into the conflict, even if one group reneges on its agreement.  Intervention is costly and many international actors either cannot credibly commit to intervene into many conflicts or have no interest in intervening into many conflicts [@kydd2006can; @fey2010shuttle; @beber2012international].  This lack of motivation is especially relevant for intergroup conflict between groups within a state.  Most international actors and strong third parties lack an incentive to intervene into intrastate intergroup conflicts, and these disputes tend to take place within states that lack the capacity to compel both sides themselves.  Since intervention is costly, strong third parties have an incentive to intervene only _after_ fighting escalates, so intervention will generally not be used to prevent conflict from escalating or to reduce the persistent, smaller-scale violence that plague many countries.  Where external actors are motivated to intervene, intervention is a short-term peace solution and its effects do not endure with the departure of the external actor [@rohner2013war; @beardsley2008agreement; @weinstein2005autonomous].  Once the external actor leaves, the groups' commitment problem returns: with no one to punish defection, the groups have no reason to trust each other.

Rather than rely on third parties to mediate or punish defection, groups in conflict can achieve peace by building mutual trust.  Reputations for trustworthiness are how groups overcome bargaining problems in the absence of formal enforcement mechanisms [@ostrom2000collective; @kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war; @ostrom2003trust].[^reputation]  Mutual trust overcomes bargaining problems because information and commitment problems are both, at their heart, problems of trust.  For information problems, groups do not trust the information they get from the other side.  For commitment problems, groups do not trust the other side to abide by its agreements.  Cultivating a reputation as a trustworthy partner in previous interactions gives a bargaining partner confidence that you are trustworthy in the present interaction.

[^reputation]: Reputations based on previous behavior work because each group wants to be known as a trustworthy partner.  As a trustworthy partner, they are likely to (1) attract other trustworthy partners, and (2) elicit trusting behavior from partners.  Though defecting may be beneficial in one specific instance, getting a reputation for defection harms a group's ability to achieve agreements in the future.  By relying on reputation and the knowledge that groups desire good reputations, groups can coordinate in the absence of a strong third party.  The reputation argument is generally mobilized for contexts in which many groups observe the behavior of each other group.  Because there are many potential partners in the future, a good reputation has high payoff in the form of many potential cooperative partners in the future.  In our case, there are two main sides forming perceptions about the reputation of each other.  This closely mimics repeating prisoner's dilemma interactions as shown in @axelrod1980effective and @axelrod1980more.

<!--@ostrom2003trust ch.2 discusses how reciprocity, reputation, and trust help overcome selfish behavior that leads to pareto-inferior outcomes;  players achieve self-enforcing equilibria by comitting themselves to punishing noncooperators to deter noncooperation; repeated games & uncertainty about player types increases cooperation; face to face interaction increases cooperation bcuz increases trust, also could add subjective value to payoff structure, gives group ID, reinforces normes, not because players realize optimal strategies and not from non-face-to-face promises.  People seek to improve values they find important.  People use heuristics; people use internal evaluations that add or subtract from objective payoffs (+ for feeling good, - for being a sucker);    ch.12 discusses how trust is minimal in situations where reputations for trust cannot be established.  @hardin2003 ch.3 gaming trust -- concept of mutual trust: trust based on long-term interaction between two parties.

<!--@tam2007 intergroup prejudice = less likely to forgive, and forgiveness is a key to intergroup cooperation [@axelrod1980effective].  Prejudiced groups cannot put previous transgressions behind them.  @gutsell2010empathy people do not naturally feel empathy for outgroup members. 

Conflicting groups dehumanize the outgroup, meaning that they do not acknowledge the outgroup as fully human [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral].  Dehumanized groups are deemed unworthy of moral considerations; they do not deserve empathy, compassion, or fair treatment.  Along with not extending morality to outgroup members, ingroups often view of the outgroup themselves as immoral -- a group without values who cannot be trusted due to their innate moral deficiencies [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435].-->

However, groups in conflict are unlikely to build trusting relationships.  Intergroup conflict fuels and is fueled by intergroup animosity, and animosity makes peace difficult to attain [@allport1954prejudice; @sherif1958superordinate].  Groups in conflict dehumanize the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral], view the outgroup as innately immoral [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435], do not naturally feel empathy for outgroup members [@gutsell2010empathy], are unlikely to forgive outgroup transgression [@tam2007impact], and believe outgroup members to be untrustworthy and dishonest [@levine1972ethnocentrism; @eidelson2003dangerous].  With this set of attitudes, outgroups are unlikely to develop reputations as trustworthy partners, even if both groups prefer mutual cooperation to war.  The groups are trapped in a mutually-defecting Prisoner's Dilemma.

## How Intergroup Animosity Perpetuates Conflict

<!--How prejudice makes intergroup bargaining more difficult.-->

<!--Bigger version of these intro paragraphs: Increasing trust amidst conflict is difficult, however, for psychological reasons.  Group conflicts are often driven and perpetuated by intergroup animosity and prejudice long after the original grievance is forgotten [@mcdonnel2017graze; cite more about intergroup conflict & intergroup prejudice].  Intergroup animosity and intergroup prejudice can be insurmountable barriers to peace for direct and indirect reasons.  Directly, highly prejudiced groups are less likely to trust information they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from the other side.  In this way, prejudice directly inhibits intergroup bargaining and prevents peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Indirectly, prejudice biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup behavior, preventing each group from updating and improving their attitudes about the other.  Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent actions as defensive and justified, whereas behavior by outgroup members may be perceived as more threatening and more malicious than the same behavior committed by a neutral party [@hewstone1990ultimate; cite fundamental/ultimate attribution error, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, anchoring bias].  The perceived negative behavior may be seen as _defining_ of the group, whereas any perceived positive behavior may be seen as the _exception_ to the group [@allison1985group; @pettigrew1979ultimate].  This biased information processing reinforces negative group stereotypes and can subvert the groups' own attempts to foster peace.  It can also sabotage intergroup bargaining by causing the groups to have inaccurate beliefs about each other and each other's willingness to make peace, adding to information and commitment problems that cause conflict.

Groups in conflict develop attitudes that make peace difficult.  _The other is innately bad, the other cannot be trusted_.  Might get psychological benefits to positive group differentiation.  Social norms might encourage animosity and punish cooperation. Group members might receive social payoffs for harming the other group.  Biased assessment of actions: Outgroup Defense of self becomes violent assault, my violent assault becomes justified retribution. fundamental attribution error, motivated reasoning.  Bargaining of leaders impossible if group members hate each other -- both leaders know that the other guy cannot commit to controlling his group.  The model: two leaders bargaining and their groups having varying levels of cohesion.-->

Pre-existing intergroup animosity prevents peaceful resolution of conflict in multiple ways.  First, and most obviously, animosity directly exacerbates bargaining problems <!-- (1) less trust == higher information and comittment problems.-->.  Mutual distrust creates information and commitment problems.  Animosity also changes the payoff that each group receives from peace and war through non-material rewards and costs, called internal evaluations [@ostrom2003trust].<!--(2) internal evalutions: "animosity may change each group's preferences for peace and war", adding psych value to fighting.  (3) internal evaluations: gains from intergroup differentiation and feelings of superiority.  (4) internal evaluations due to social benefits/domestic audience costs -->  Second, animosity biases perceptions of ingroup and outgroup behavior and preferences.  These biases increase the likelihood that each group misperceives the other side's intentions and prevents groups from developing reputations for trustworthiness. <!--(5) biased info processing, increases likelihood of misperceptions of outgroup type. -->

<!--Wood's 2000 review of persuasion gave two additional functions of attitudes that apply to intergroup attitudes: self-concept and social adjustment [@wood2000attitude].  Self-concept refers to an individual's identity.  If an individual's identity is strongly related to ingroup superiority, she may not want to have better attitudes about the outgroup.  Social adjustment refers to an individual's desire to obtain social rewards.  If an individual's group opposes the outgroup and sanctions those who do not oppose the outgroup, she also has a strong reason to maintain negative outgroup attitudes.-->

Intergroup animosity prevents peace by directly exacerbating bargaining problems.  First, information and commitment problems are more likely to occur because groups are less likely to trust information they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from the other side.  Second, animosity may change each groups preferences for peace and war.  Individual group members might receive psychological benefits from "beating" the other side and from social differentiation with the outgroup [@wood2000attitude].  Many groups define "us" by positive differences with a "them", and an individual can derive self-esteem from positively comparing their group identity to a rival group [@tajfel1981groups; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup].  When group members derive self-esteem from feeling superior to an outgroup, group members may reject actions that recognize the outgroup as equals and rhetoric about group similarity due to cognitive dissonance.  With these internal evaluations of peace and war, any outcome in which the other side achieves _any_ utility could be viewed as a loss.  Groups that see the other side as immoral may even receive some internal benefit from _harming_ the outgroup [@weisel2015ingroup].

Along with psychological benefits, group members may receive social benefits for strong anti-outgroup stances and social sanctioning for cooperative behavior.  The utility a group members gets for attitudes and behaviors depends largely on how those attitudes and behaviors are received by their ingroup [@wood2000attitude].  If group members perceive outgroup animosity as socially desirable, they may profess attitudes and engage in behaviors that signal outgroup animosity.  These social _benefits_ also entail reciprocal social _costs_ that constrain the actions of group members and group leaders.  Individuals who cooperate with the outgroup, as opposed to taking a hard stance against the other side's perceived transgressions, might be accused of betraying the outgroup for cooperating [@dreu2010social].  Individuals in these groups might not engage in ingroup policing, a strong, costly signal to the other side that your group will uphold its peace agreements [@fearon1996explaining].  While cooperation and ingroup policing might be punished, aggressive actions may be seen as righteous self-defense of the ingroup and rewarded.

Leaders are also constrained by animosity among their group.  Groups are known to punish leaders for cooperating or compromising with the outgroup [@fearon1994domestic], so the set of peace agreements available to the leader of one group is likely unacceptable to the other.<!--chris: domestic audience costs-->.  Leaders of hostile groups also cannot credibly commit to keep their group members in check, as some subgroups may feel confident enough to disobey agreements made by group leaders.  Due to increased (1) likelihood of information and commitment problems, (2) internal psychological evaluations that favor competition over cooperation, and (3) social sanctioning for group members and leaders perceived as betraying the ingroup, animosity reduces the likelihood of successful bargaining and makes violent conflict more likely.<!--chris: need better discussion of internal evaluations -->

Animosity also sabotages peace in indirect, pernicious ways.  Indirectly, intergroup animosity biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup behavior and prevents accurate perceptions about the attitudes and preferences of the outgroup.  Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent actions as defensive and justified, and are more likely to perceive outgroup actions as aggressive, negatively motivated, and unjustified [@hewstone1990ultimate; @amir1969contact; @hunter1991intergroup chris: also cite confirmation bias, anchoring bias].  <!--If groups want to dislike each other, they will. Klein and Kunda, brewer1991/1999 -->  The perceived negative behavior may be seen as _defining_ the group, whereas any perceived positive behavior may be seen as the _exception_ to the group [@allison1985group; @pettigrew1979ultimate].  Even positive intergroup interactions may be re-interpreted as negative to avoid cognitive dissonance [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @gubler2013humanizing; @paolini2010negative].  Interpreting interactions negatively saps the power of each group to reassure the other with costly signals of willingness to cooperate in future interactions [@kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war].  It also adds to information problems as groups will hold inaccurate views about each other's willingness to cooperate and likelihood of upholding agreements.  As @axelrod1980effective shows, perceived untrustworthy behavior by one side often begets a cycle of mistrust.

<!--reputation as a mean of overcoming comittment problems when there is no third party.  How prejudice and biased interpretations of behavior prevent reputations from forming, even when both groups are the "complier" type.-->

The indirect effect of animosity on intergroup bargaining poses a major obstacle to groups overcoming bargaining problems through trustworthy reputations.  Groups tend to ascribe negative traits to the outgroup, and also tend to remember negative events that corroborate their negative beliefs [@tajfel1981groups, @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup; @klein1992motivated; @brewer1991social].  Groups in conflict are given many events to justify their negative perceptions.  Initial negative perceptions, and the biased interpretations they beget, make it very difficult for a group to develop a positive reputation with a group they are in conflict with, even when both groups are motivated to end the conflict.  This bias likely pushes each group's perception of the other side's willingness to make peace further from their true willingness to make peace and so reputations hinder, rather than aid, intergroup bargaining processes.

Reputations for trustworthiness are also hampered by a lack of opportunities for groups to observe each others behavior and update perceptions of the outgroup's trustworthiness.  Compounding that problem, few of the outgroup's interactions will be with groups that are relevant for predicting the outgroup's behavior towards the ingroup, providing fewer opportunities for updating.  This means that the main opportunity to observe outgroup behavior and learn their reputation is the ingroup's own interactions with the outgroup.  For groups in conflict, these opportunities are likely rare and almost always adversarial.
<!--
(This also means that the outgroup has less incentive to cooperate with your ingroup because they are less likely to be punished for defecting in a world where reputation is built off of _experienced_ interactions, rather than previous _observed_ interactions. [chris: Scott Page's coursera on overcoming collective action problems cites a model where the more people who can see your interaction the more incentive you have to cooperate.].  Not sure this is relevant.) <!--Mediation can also be good when the groups are likely to say inflammatory things to each other.  Going through a mediator prevents that. chris: don't remember the citation, and this belongs in a diff section. -->

<!--Reputations are most useful when (1) when each group knows its behavior will be viewed by many other groups and (2) a group's reputation can be gleaned from observing the other side's interactions with many other groups.  Unlike trade situations, groups in conflict  are unlikely to have a -->

## Peacebuilding Interventions to Increase Trust

<!--Bottom-up intergroup contact.  Define what it is, when it should work.-->

The problems of negative intergroup attitudes suggests that improving those attitudes could lead to peace-promoting behaviors and reduce conflict.  One approach to improving intergroup attitudes comes from intergroup contact theory [@allport1954prejudice].  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will improve intergroup relations.  Improving relations -- especially improving trust -- can help groups overcome bargaining problems and reduce the likelihood of violence.

Intergroup contact theory posits four conditions necessary for intergroup contact to improve relations.  Groups must (1) cooperate (2) with equal status (3) to achieve shared goals (4) with the support of elites.[^otherContact]  Myriad ways that contact could improve intergroup relations.  Could change perceptions and replace negative imagined stereotypes with positive direct experiences.   

Could improve reputations/remove stereotypes.  Increase perception of trustworthiness/intergroup trust.  Contact gives opportunity for costly signals.  Reputations will help groups overcome information and commitment problems.  Groups trust information they get from the other group.  Groups trust the other group to abide by agreements because they believe the other group is also motivated by peace.






Could change emotional reactions to the group, either by increasing feelings of empathy or decreasing feelings of threat.  

Could cause groups to reconceptualize their ingroup to include the former outgroup.  Seeing our two groups as one, seeing our incentives as aligned.  

Could create cognitive dissonance that allows individuals to re-evaluate their beliefs [@gubler].

Can give group members interactions that reduce perceptual biases.  And about perceptual fairness/unbiasedness: we will interpret things you do fairly and we will interpret things we do fairly (i.e. we will not think everything we do is justified and everything you do is unjustified).  

Costly signals: gives each group the opportunity to give strong costly signals about a group's reputation and the "group type" as a conditional complier: we will honor our agreements if you honor yours.

Other perspectives focus on the achievement of a joint goal that shows both groups they are _materially_ better off [superordinate goal/RGCT].  The intergroup contact to focus on superordinate goals so the groups can see how intergroup cooperation benefits both sides materially [@sherif1958superordinate].  Sees how _both groups_ have a self-interested incentive to cooperate with peace agreements.

[^otherContact]: Under other conditions -- incidental contact, intergroup competition, interactions in which one group has power over the other, elite disapproval of intergroup contact -- the structure of the contact may _not_ improve relations [@enos2014causal; @forbes1997ethnic]<!--hhabyarimana et al 2007; vanhanen 1999-->.]



Groups wondering which type the other group is and making decisions based on that perception.  If other group will cooperate, we should cooperate.  If other group defects, we should defect.  Groups can learn how each other will respond to big interactions by how they respond to smaller interactions.  

When groups are in conflict, most incidental intergroup contact will be highly adversarial. 

Groups need opportunity to signal trustworthiness and preferences for cooperation [@kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war].  Structured intergroup contact provides opportunities for these signals.  When the contact is group-to-group, trustworthy behavior by the outgroup is immediately known by several ingroup members.  

Ingroup identification does not necessitate outgroup hate [@allport1954prejudice; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup; @halevy2008group].

<!--
Talk about ways this type of thing _could_ solve conflict.  Could solve information problem, could solve comittment problem.  Could encourage sharing/bargaining over resources instead of competition/conflict over resources.  Receive information directly, not from a mediator (who may be biased for one side or for peace).  Opportunities for costly signaling and ingroup policing/censuring [@ditlmann2017addressing; @Fearon1996].  Ingroup policing works because we cannot do things if our community dislikes those things.-->

<!--Could change stereotypes -- attributes that are applied to the outgroup, focusing on trustworthiness. Solving commit problem. Solve information problem.-->


Can decrease prejudice and encourage ingroup policing.  Decrease prejudice also allows leaders to credibly commit entire group to peace.  Encourage ingroup policing.  Create norms against prejudice and violence, or connect existing norms to the outgroup by humanizing the outgroup.

Could improve dispute resolution and reduce conflict over resources.  Encourage sharing resources _or_ separation of resources.  Mediation training -- help community leaders resolve disputes.

Could decrease threat, though in cases of active conflict this might exacerbate rather than solve conflict (information about reduced outgroup threat == higher chance of my group winning).

Could increase empathy.  Seeing the other side's argument, seeing their motivations. Increase empathy/less prejudice helps interpret information in non-biased way. [Chris: cite literature on empathy making me interpret information about other people more accurately.  Kertzer?]

Groups work together to gain more material resources, improves us now, makes me think working together in the _future_ would be good. Realistic Group Conflict Theory -- resource competition causes conflict, and intergroup relations improved when the groups work together to improve material status of both groups.

Can give group members the capacity to affect conflict.

As an alternative to top-down international intervention to reduce conflict, bottom-up peacebuilding programs can reduce conflict by focusing on both the immediate economic concerns contributing to conflict (superordinate goals?) and the psychological attitudes contributing to conflict. Bottom-up psychological reconciliation programs should work for the types of conflicts for which international intervention is rarely used and is unlikely to be successful.  Persistent intergroup conflict that plagues many countries.  Low-level conflict before it builds to large-scale conflict.  There are XX conflicts of this type accounting for XX deaths each year.

## Why Peacebuilding Could Fail

Yet peacebuilding generally, and intergroup contact specifically, may not work in contexts of ongoing violence.  Many top-down attempts to solve bargaining problems with a strong external actor (through mediation and intervention) are ineffective while conflict is going on and only effective at maintaining peace once the formal conflict has ended.  Likewise, psychological reconciliation may prevent resumption of conflict but requires conflict to already be resolved [@bar2000intractable].  Active conflict produces many grievances and high prejudice; cognitive dissonance causes backlash for the most prejudiced people [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @gubler2011diss].  Negative contact experiences reinforce negative stereotypes [@paolini2010negative]. Motivated reasoning for attitudes towards others [@klein1992motivated].  If you don't want to like someone, you will find a reason not to.  Many reasons contact may not work in this context.

Intergroup conflict is commitment problem solved by strong third party [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war] and bottom-up programs do not provide a strong third party that can enforce commitments.  Psychological reconciliation is not how we've thought of solving commitment problems between conflicting groups or improving reputations.  Can psych reconciliation improve reputations in contexts of ongoing violence?  

Underlying cause of conflict still present.  Groups still engage in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

The intergroup animosity comes from real conflict, not the type of prejudice that Allport and others theorized about.  Through contact, you might learn that the other group _does_ favor itself.  Contact might show you that the other group _will_ defect on agreements.

Few norms against prejudice, possibly group norms that support this particular intergroup prejudice.  If intergroup contact works by activating "norms against prejudice", unlikely to work here.

Intergroup contact may only reduce prejudice from high-status group to low-status group.

Relative deprivation theory: the groups still see the other as responsible for ingroup deprivations.

# Moved from Intro

When both groups desire some valuable $X$ they must come to an agreement about the division of $X$ based on the existing strategic situation.  In dynamic settings where the strategic situation is unstable, groups cannot credibly commit to abide by their agrements; when the situation changes, one group will have an incentive to renege on the deal.  Bargaining breaks down because both sides know that neither can credibly commit to any bargaining agreement.  In the absence of a bargained solution groups use violence to settle disputes over $X$.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is a strong neutral third-party to solve the comittment problem by compelling each side to honor bargaining agreements.  This is an example of institutions constraining behavior.<!--Possibly next paragraph talks about government intervention over land use to compel each side.  But government is weak and unable to compel each sides; and pastoralists view the government as very partial to the farmers. -->
<!--
Intergroup violence is also considered a product of intergroup prejudice and dehumanization ^[cite: humanizing the outgroup stuff, @halperin2011emotional; also cite: tajfel, ].  Chris: argument.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is to reduce prejudice and humanize the outgroup; provide superordinate goals that show groups the benefit of working together.  

Even some proponents of the psychological perspective doubt the ability of intergroup contact to reduce violent conflict [@gubler; @saguy2011tension; others.]

Models say intergroup bargaining should work.  Groups should be able to form reputations for trustworthiness.  Groups are not doing so.
Negative affect makes it difficult to develop intergroup trust.
intergroup contact can increase trust even when groups don't like each other.



The story is "Theoretical models of conflict say that groups should be able to solve their problems through bargaining.  When external actors are not present to guarantee bargained agreements, groups use trust.  But it's hard for groups who don't like each other to develop trust.  Cooperative contact can build trust even in these contexts."

The only thing we do not specifically measure is "these groups don't like each other".  I don't think readers will reject the idea that these groups dislike each other.

The lack of effect on intergroup cohesion, which you cited above, is not a problem for this "trust" theory.  No increase on cohesion means the groups are not seeing themselves as more similar.  The trust theory would not say that these groups would see themselves as more similar.
