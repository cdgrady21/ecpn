## Intergroup Conflict as a Bargaining Problem
<!--Typical solutions strive to solve intergroup bargaining problem.  Information and comittment problems.  Define these problems.  3rd parties (peacekeepers, states) solve comittments problems by adding large costs to defecting on agreements.  Mediation works when it solves the information problem. -->

Intergroup conflict is most often conceptualized as a bargaining problem [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war], and most solutions to reducing intergroup conflict strive to help the groups overcome those bargaining problems [@di2017effectiveness].  Intergroup conflict is a bargaining problem because both groups want some resource -- land, power, etc -- but cannot reach an agreement about how to distribute that resource peacefully.  Because fighting is costly, the groups _should_ be able to reach a bargained compromise without fighting.  However, two bargaining problems prevent this: information problems and commitment problems.  To successfully bargain, the groups need (1) accurate information about each other, and (2) the assurance that each side will abide by its agreements.  

An _information problem_ arises because neither group has accurate information about the other, and both groups have an incentive to deceive the other.  This causes bargaining failures because neither group knows what payoff to expect from bargaining.  A _comittment problem_ arises because neither group can credibly commit to bargained agreements in an uncertain and unstable strategic landscape.  The strategic landscape is uncertain and unstable because internal and external factors that affect each group's preferences and capabilities are likely to change.  Internally, one group may disarm before the other, the groups may have factions that reject the agreement, the groups may change leaders, or group members attitudes may change for other reasons.  Externally, the groups may gain or lose de facto or de jure state support, other external actors may switch allegiances, or some other shock may change each group's power relative to the other [@fearon2004civil; chris: need to cite and add more].  Because their agreements are not enforceable, both groups know that the other group cannot commit to agreements if incentives change in the future.  Without the ability to commit to agreements, bargaining cannot truly begin.

Groups in conflict overcome these bargaining problems in several ways.  Groups can overcome information problems through fighting, as they learn about each others capacity [@smith2003mediation].  Groups can also overcome information problems through mediation.  A third party mediator with no stake in the conflict can provide accurate information to both sides, helping each side agree to the value each should receive from bargaining.

Even if groups overcome information problems, they must still overcome commitment problems.  Groups can overcome commitment problems through strong third parties that add large costs to reneging on agreements [@fearon1998comittment; @powell2006war; @doyle2000international].  Though each group may have an incentive to defect on their agreement based on future changes in the strategic environment, the groups have no incentive to defect if a strong third party is capable and willing to punish defection from bargained agreements.  With a third party punishing defection, the groups can bargain in good faith knowing that the other will abide by its word.  The international community often fill the role of strong third party in intergroup disputes.

## The Persistence of Intergroup Conflict

<!--conflict persists because biased mediation, lack of motivation to intervene. -->

If we know how to resolve intergroup conflict, why does conflict persist?  International mediation and intervention are dogged by two issues of motivation.  First, mediators, by their very nature, are motivated for peace.  But this motivation implies that information provided by mediators is biased towards encouraging the groups to negotiate a peace agreement. Since both groups know that mediators are biased towards peace, mediators may not reduce information problems [@smith2003mediation; @kydd2006can].  Second, international actors may lack the motivation to mediate or to intervene into the conflict, even if one group reneges on its agreement.  Intervention is costly and so international actors cannot credibly commit to intervene into the conflict unless they have a stake in the conflict [@kydd2006can].  

This lack of motivation is especially relevant for intergroup conflict between groups within a state.  Most international actors and strong third parties lack an incentive to intervene into intrastate intergroup conflicts, and these disputes tend to take place within states that lack the capacity to compel both sides themselves.  Since intervention is costly, strong third parties have an incentive to intervene only _after_ fighting escalates, so intervention will generally not be used to prevent conflict from escalating or to reduce the persistent, smaller-scale violence that plague many countries.  The lack of a strong third party to prevent the intergroup bargaining failures that causes persistent intergroup conflict is a serious barrier to peace.

<!--How prejudice makes intergroup bargaining more difficult.-->

<!--Groups in conflict develop attitudes that make peace difficult.  _The other is innately bad, the other cannot be trusted_.  Might get psychological benefits to positive group differentiation.  Social norms might encourage animosity and punish cooperation. Group members might receive social payoffs for harming the other group.  Biased assessment of actions: Outgroup Defense of self becomes violent assault, my violent assault becomes justified retribution. fundamental attribution error, motivated reasoning.  Bargaining of leaders impossible if group members hate each other -- both leaders know that the other guy cannot commit to controlling his group.  The model: two leaders bargaining and their groups having varying levels of cohesion.-->

Conflict also persist due to intergroup prejudice.  Groups in competition and conflict develop prejudiced attitudes that make peace difficult to attain [@allport1954prejudice; @sherif1958superordinate].  Conflicting groups think the outgroup is untrustworthy, selfishly motivated, and innately bad.  These prejudiced attitudes feed the conflict and prevent the groups from obtaining peace.

One way intergroup prejudice prevents peace is by exacerbating bargaining problems.  At their heart, information and commitment problems are both problems of trust.  For information problems, groups do not trust the information they get from the other group.  For commitment problems, groups do not trust the other group to abide by its agreements.  Highly prejudiced groups are less likely to trust information they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from the other side.  As a result, these groups are unlikely to overcome problems of trust without third-party intervention.  <!--Chris: not really nailing this and next paragraph yet -->

These negative attitudes also change the payoff structure for bargaining, both for leaders and for individuals who encounter disagreements with outgroup members.  The payoff an individual gets for attitudes and behaviors depends largely on how those attitudes and behaviors are received by their ingroup.  These "social payoffs" constrain the actions of leaders and individual group members.  In the context of outgroup prejudice, the group might punish a leader for cooperating or compromising with the outgroup [@fearon1994domestic].  Individuals might get similarly socially punished for cooperating instead of taking a hard stand against the other side's perceived transgressions.  Leaders of highly prejudiced groups also cannot credibly commit to keep their group members in check.  Individuals in highly prejudiced groups might not engage in ingroup policing, a strong, costly signal to the other side that your group will uphold its peace agreements [@fearon1996explaining].  While cooperation and ingroup policing might be punished, aggressive actions may be seen as righteous self-defense of the ingroup and rewarded.

Along with social benefits from aggressive attitudes and behavior, individuals might receive psychological benefits from conflict and from social differentiation with the outgroup.  Many groups define "us" by positive differences with a "them", and an individual can derive self-esteem from positively comparing their group identity to a rival group [@tajfel1981groups; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup].  When group members derive self-esteem from feeling superior to an outgroup, group members may reject rhetoric about group similarity due to cognitive dissonance it causes them.  Group members may also reject actions that recognize the outgroup as equals.

<!--reputation as a mean of overcoming comittment problems when there is no third party.  How prejudice and biased interpretations of behavior prevent reputations from forming, even when both groups are the "complier" type.-->

When there is no strong third party to enforce bargaining agreements, commitment problems are often overcome by reputations.  Reputations, beliefs that groups have about the likely behavior of other actors, allow groups to bargain and negotiate even without an organization willing to punish defection from agreements.  Though defecting may be beneficial in one specific instance, groups may not defect because getting a reputation for defecting on agreements harms a group's ability to achieve agreements in the future.  By relying on reputation and the knowledge that groups desire good reputations, groups can coordinate in the absence of a strong third party.

The reputation mechanism could prevent intergroup conflict but reputations, too, are hampered by prejudice.  Prejudice biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup behavior, which makes it very difficult for a group to develop a positive reputation with a group they are in conflict with, even when both groups are motivated to end the conflict.  Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent actions as defensive and justified, and are more likely to perceive outgroup actions as aggressive, negatively motivated, and unjustified [chris: fundamental attribution error, group attribution error, biased interpretations].  This bias likely pushes each group's perception of the other side's willingness to make peace further from their true willingness to make peace and so reputations hinder, rather than aid, intergroup bargaining processes.

Reputations to prevent conflict are also hampered by a lack of opportunities for groups to observe each others behavior and to learn the outgroup's reputation.  Compounding that problem, few of the outgroup's interactions will be with groups in which the outgroup's behavior towards that group is relevant for the outgroup's behavior towards my group.  This means that the main opportunity to observe outgroup behavior and learn their reputation is your own interactions with the outgroup.  For groups in conflict, these opportunities are likely rare and almost always adversarial.

(This also means that the outgroup has less incentive to cooperate with your ingroup because they are less likely to be punished for defecting in a world where reputation is built off of _experienced_ interactions, rather than previous _observed_ interactions. [chris: Scott Page's coursera on overcoming collective action problems cites a model where the more people who can see your interaction the more incentive you have to cooperate.].  Not sure this is relevant.)


## Psychological Reconciliation to Reduce Prejudice and Conflict

<!--Bottom-up Psychological reconciliation, intergroup contact.  Define what it is, when it should work.-->

The problems of negative intergroup attitudes suggests that improving those attitudes could lead to peace-promoting behaviors and reduce conflict.  One of the most promising approaches to improving intergroup attitudes comes from intergroup contact theory.  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will reduce prejudice.  Reducing prejudice can help groups overcome bargaining problems and reduce the likelihood of violence.

When groups are in conflict, most incidental intergroup contact will be highly adversarial.  Intergroup contact theory posits several conditions necessary for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice.  Groups must cooperate with equal status to achieve shared goals with the support of elites.  Intergroup contact under these conditions gives the ability give strong costly signals about a group's reputation and the "group type" as a conditional complier: we will honor our agreements if you honor yours.  And about perceptual fairness/unbiasedness: we will interpret things you do fairly and we will interpret things we do fairly (i.e. we will not think everything we do is justified and everything you do is unjustified).

It is important for the intergroup contact to focus on superordinate goals [@sherif1954].  

<!--
Talk about ways this type of thing _could_ solve conflict.  Could solve information problem, could solve comittment problem.  Could encourage sharing/bargaining over resources instead of competition/conflict over resources.  Receive information directly, not from a mediator (who may be biased for one side or for peace).  Opportunities for costly signaling and ingroup policing/censuring [@ditlmann2017addressing; @Fearon1996].  Ingroup policing works because we cannot do things if our community dislikes those things.-->

<!--Could change stereotypes -- attributes that are applied to the outgroup, focusing on trustworthiness. Solving commit problem. Solve information problem.-->

Could improve reputations/remove stereotypes.  Increase perception of trustworthiness/intergroup trust.  Contact gives opportunity for costly signals.  Reputations will help groups overcome information and commitment problems.  Groups trust information they get from the other group.  Groups trust the other group to abide by agreements because they believe the other group is also motivated by peace.

Can give group members interactions that reduce perceptual biases.  Can decrease prejudice and encourage ingroup policing.  Decrease prejudice also allows leaders to credibly commit entire group to peace.  Encourage ingroup policing.  Create norms against prejudice and violence, or connect existing norms to the outgroup by humanizing the outgroup.

Could improve dispute resolution and reduce conflict over resources.  Encourage sharing resources _or_ separation of resources.  Mediation training -- help community leaders resolve disputes.

Could decrease threat, though in cases of active conflict this might exacerbate rather than solve conflict (information about reduced outgroup threat == higher chance of my group winning).

Could increase empathy.  Seeing the other side's argument, seeing their motivations. Increase empathy/less prejudice helps interpret information in non-biased way. [Chris: cite literature on empathy making me interpret information about other people more accurately.  Kertzer?]

Could expand ingroup/make group similarities salient.  Seeing our two groups as one, seeing our incentives as aligned.

Groups work together to gain more material resources, improves us now, makes me think working together in the _future_ would be good.

Can give group members the capacity to affect conflict.

As an alternative to top-down international intervention to reduce conflict, bottom-up peacebuilding programs can reduce conflict by focusing on both the immediate economic concerns contributing to conflict (superordinate goals?) and the psychological attitudes contributing to conflict. Bottom-up psychological reconciliation programs should work for the types of conflicts for which international intervention is rarely used and is unlikely to be successful.  Persistent intergroup conflict that plagues many countries.  Low-level conflict before it builds to large-scale conflict.  There are XX conflicts of this type accounting for XX deaths each year.

## Why Bottom-up Programs Could Fail

Yet bottom-up peacebuilding generally, and intergroup contact specifically, may not work in contexts of ongoing violence.  As with mediation and intervention, bottom-up reconciliation programs may be ineffective while conflict is going on and only effective at maintaining peace once the formal conflict has ended.  Many reasons contact may not work in this context.

Intergroup conflict is commitment problem solved by strong third party [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war] and bottom-up programs do not provide a strong third party that can enforce commitments.  Psychological reconciliation is not how we've thought of solving commitment problems between conflicting groups or improving reputations.  Can psych reconciliation improve reputations in contexts of ongoing violence?  

Psychological reconciliation can prevent resumption of conflict but requires conflict to already be resolved [@bar2000intractable].  Active conflict produces many grievances and high prejudice; cognitive dissonance causes backlash for the most prejudiced people [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @gubler2011diss].  Negative contact experiences reinforce negative stereotypes [@paolini2010negative]. Motivated reasoning for attitudes towards others [@klein1992motivated].  If you don't want to like someone, you will find a reason not to.

Underlying cause of conflict still present.  Groups still engage in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

Few norms against prejudice, possibly group norms that support this particular intergroup prejudice.  If intergroup contact works by activating "norms against prejudice", unlikely to work here.

Intergroup contact may only reduce prejudice from high-status group to low-status group.

In this case, bias for or against one side of the conflict can increase the effectiveness of intervention [@kydd2003side; @regan2002third] because it provides motivation for the international community to intervene in the conflict.

# Moved from Intro

When both groups desire some valuable $X$ they must come to an agreement about the division of $X$ based on the existing strategic situation.  In dynamic settings where the strategic situation is unstable, groups cannot credibly commit to abide by their agrements; when the situation changes, one group will have an incentive to renege on the deal.  Bargaining breaks down because both sides know that neither can credibly commit to any bargaining agreement.  In the absence of a bargained solution groups use violence to settle disputes over $X$.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is a strong neutral third-party to solve the comittment problem by compelling each side to honor bargaining agreements.  This is an example of institutions constraining behavior.<!--Possibly next paragraph talks about government intervention over land use to compel each side.  But government is weak and unable to compel each sides; and pastoralists view the government as very partial to the farmers. -->
<!--
Intergroup violence is also considered a product of intergroup prejudice and dehumanization ^[cite: humanizing the outgroup stuff, @halperin2011emotional; also cite: tajfel, ].  Chris: argument.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is to reduce prejudice and humanize the outgroup; provide superordinate goals that show groups the benefit of working together.  

Even some proponents of the psychological perspective doubt the ability of intergroup contact to reduce violent conflict [@gubler; @saguy2011tension; others.]
