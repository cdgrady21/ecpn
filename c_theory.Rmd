# Theory

<!--Typical solutions strive to solve intergroup bargaining problem.  Information and comittment problems.  Define these problems.  3rd parties (peacekeepers, states) solve comittments problems by adding large costs to defecting on agreements.  Mediation works when it solves the information problem. -->

Most solutions to reducing intergroup conflict strive to help the groups overcome bargaining problems.  Because fighting is costly, the groups _should_ be able to reach a bargained compromise without fighting.  However, two bargaining problem prevent this: information problems and comittment problems.  Information problem: neither groups have accurate information about the other, and both groups have an incentive to deceive the other.  Comittment problem: neither group can commit to agreements because situation changes.  One group may disarm before the other, external actors may switch allegiances [chris: need to find cites for things and add more here].  Both groups know that the other group cannot commit to agreements.  Cannot even begin to bargain.

Groups in conflict overcome these bargaining problems in several ways.  Groups can overcome the information problem through fighting, as they learn about each other's capacity [@smith2003mediation].  Groups can also overcome the information problem through mediation.  A third party with no stake in the conflict can provide accurate information to both sides.

Even if groups overcome the information problem, they may have a comittment problem.  Groups can overcome the comittment problem through strong third parties that add large costs to reneging on agreements [@fearon1998comittment; @powell2006war].  Though each group may have an incentive to defect on their agreement based on future changes in the strategic environment, the groups are convinced to bargain by the presence of a strong third party that is both capable and willing to punish defection.  Since each group trusts that the other side will abide by its word, they can reach an agreement.  Peacekeepers and the international community often fill the role of strong third party.


<!--Not always feasible to do these things, and these things don't always work.  Say why: costly, biased mediators, no state to project power, etc. -->

If we know about solutions to intergroup conflict, why does it persist?  Mediation can only help solve the information problem if the mediators themselves are unbiased.  Mediators, by their very nature, are biased towards peace.  Since both groups know that, mediators may not be effective at reducing information problems [@smith2003mediation].

International intervention to guarantee bargained agreements is costly.  For international disputes, there is often no 3rd party strong and willing enough to compel both sides.  For disputes within a country, the state often lacks the capability to compel both sides.  International intervention is generally only used _after_ fighting escalates; it does not prevent the fighting from escalating.  And it is too costly for the persistent, smaller-scale conflicts that plague many countries.


<!--Talk about psychological challenges to resolving conflict.  Groups in conflict develop attitudes that make peace difficult.  _The other is innately bad, the other cannot be trusted_.  Might get psychological benefits to positive group differentiation.  Social norms might encourage animosity and punish cooperation. Group members might receive social payoffs for harming the other group.  Outgroup Defense of self becomes violent assault, my violent assault becomes justified retribution. fundamental attribution error, motivated reasoning.-->

As an alternative to top-down international intervention to reduce conflict, bottom-up peacebuilding programs can reduce conflict by focusing on both the immediate economic concerns contributing to conflict and the psychological attitudes contributing to conflict.  Groups in conflict often develop attitudes that make peace difficult to attain.  The groups might think the other is untrustworthy and innately bad.  

The negative attitudes exacerbate bargaining problems.  Both information and comittment problems are problems of trust.  Groups do not trust the information they get from the other group.  Groups do not trust the other group to abide by its agreements.

These negative attitudes also change the calculus for bargaining.  Might get psychological benefits to positive group differentiation.  Social norms might encourage animosity and punish cooperation. Group members might receive social payoffs for harming the other group.

<!--Bottom-up Psychological reconciliation, intergroup contact.  Define what it is, when it should work.-->




## Psych Reconciliation not working (orthodox view/pessimist group)

<!--
- Many reasons contact may not work in this context
    - Intergroup conflict as commitment problem [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war]; contact/intergroup is not a formal institution that can enforce commitments, not how we've thought of solving comittment problems.
    - Competition for resources [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].  Psych Reconciliation does not change the underlying cause of conflict.
    - Psychological reconciliation can prevent resumption of conflict but requires conflict to already be resolved  [@bar2000intractable]
\pause
\bigskip
    - Active conflict produces many grievances and high prejudice; cognitive dissonance causes backlash for the most prejudiced people [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @gubler2011diss]
    - Negative contact experiences reinforce negative stereotypes [@paolini2010negative]
    - Motivated reasoning for attitudes towards others [@klein1992motivated]
    - Few norms against prejudice.  Extent that contact activates "norms against prejudice", no good here. 
    
-->

## Psych reconciliaiton could work

<!--
Talk about ways this type of thing _could_ solve conflict.  Could solve information problem, could solve comittment problem.  Could encourage sharing/bargaining over resources instead of competition/conflict over resources.  Receive information directly, not from a mediator (who may be biased for one side or for peace).  Opportunities for costly signaling and ingroup censuring [@ditlmann2017addressing; @Fearon1996]-->

<!--Could change stereotypes -- attributes that are applied to the outgroup, focusing on trustworthiness. Solving commit problem. Solve information problem.-->

Could decrease threat, though in cases of active conflict this might exacerbate rather than solve conflict (information about reduced outgroup threat == higher chance of my group winning).

Could increase empathy.  Seeing the other side's argument, seeing their motivations. Increase empathy/less prejudice helps interpret information in non-biased way. Chris: look for literature on empathy making me interpret information about other people more accurately.  Kertzer?

Could expand ingroup/make group similarities salient.  Seeing our two groups as one, seeing our incentives as aligned.

Chris: in ECPN program, groups work together to gain more material resources, improves us now, makes me think working together in the _future_ would be good.  Also role of leaders in mediating disputes (mediaiton training).












# Thinking

Big framing points:

- Contact theory can be effective at reducing real world conflict.
- Contact increases intergroup trust, which allows groups to bargain even in the absence of external costs of breaking agreements.

Intergroup conflict is often characterized as a bargaining failure<!--Prisoner's Dilemma?-->.  Both groups would benefit from compromise, but negotiations break down and conflict ensues because neither group trusts the other to abide by their agreements.  The proposed solutions are coercive institutions that prevent groups from defecting on bargained agreements.  However, coercive power cannot reach many group conflicts.  We propose intergroup contact as an alternative to coercive institutions.  Coercive institutions substitute for intergroup trust, but intergroup contact can foster intergroup trust directly by creating situations in which groups can signal their trustworthiness.  Intergroup trust allows groups to bargain even in the absence of coercive institutions.

Theory sections tend to summarize a literature and then apply it to new area.

# Outline/Presentation intro slide

- Intergroup conflict as commitment problem, solved by institution that can enforce commitments [@fearon; @powell]
- Institutions that constrain behavior cannot always be present
- Intergroup trust serves as social institution that solves commitment problem
- Intergroup contact creates intergroup trust

# Theory (12-20 para)

Two big theoretical literatures on intergroup conflict.  One sees intergroup conflict as bargaining problem.  The other sees intergroup prejudice as a prejudice problem.

Intergroup conflict is often considered the result of bargaining failures.  Groups have disagreements, but through bargaining they should be reach a compromise that prevents conflict.  Neither group _wants_ conflict because conflict is very costly for both groups.  Groups fail to reach bargaining agreements primarily due to comittment problems -- neither group trusts that other group will honor comittments [@fearon; @powell].  Groups cannot be trusted to commit to agreements for a variety of reasons.

[^bargainFail:] Other reasons are incorrect information.

The solution to the comittment problem are institutions or external actors that punish defection from agreements.

These institutions cannot always be present.  State power does not reach everywhere.  No neutral/trusted arbitrator.  Enforcement expensive.  Need something that functions like police but without police walking around punishing everyone

These institutions substitute for intergroup trust.  We can bargain without external enforcement if we trust each other to uphold agreements.  Bargaining allows groups to reach a non-violent outcome.

## Intergroup Contact

Intergroup contact creates social institutions that affect/constrain behavior. Intergroup contact theory: Intergroup cooperation to achieve common goals in an equal status context with the support of authorities reduces prejudice [@allport1954prejudice]
- Shown effective in many contexts [@pettigrew2006meta]
- Intergroup contact produces trust via opportunities for costly signaling(<!--through ingroup policing?)--> and increased likelihood that defections from agreement will become public and therefore punished.


**It could convince the groups that cooperation is good**/**It could decrease the social benefits of conflict**
Changing the game: [c,c] payoffs higher than [c,d or d,d] payoffs.  Before contact, could get social benefits to defecting and social costs to cooperating, so cooperating was not in anyone's interest.  After contact, social benefits from cooperating and social costs to defecting. Or something like that.

If groups hate each other, maybe social benefits to attacking the other group.  Feels justified.  If groups don't hate so much, maybe social costs instead.

** It could convince the groups that the other side will cooperate**
Allows costly signaling that my groups type is conditional complier, not defector.  Increases trust that other group will cooperate.  Increase opportunities for group reputations to increase.  In game theory terms, direct reciprocity.

**It could increase the acceptable bargaining space**
Before, both groups would only accept agreements where they got 75% or more, so there was no agreement space.
This is more a story about perceived strength: why would I only accept bargaining where I would receive 75%+ if I thought the alternative to bargaining was you beating me and taking 100%?




**Alternative Mechanisms of Intergroup Contact**
Generalized trust -- no increase to "people of other religions/ethnicities"
Decreased threat -- nope
Ingroup increases to include other group -- intergroup cohesion does not seem to increase.  Probably not that ingroup norms being extended to outgroup.
incresed empathy -- no questions address this, or intergroup cohesion 2?
Perceived benefits of cooperation -- maybe?  But contact does not increase this.

**Limitations**
Most effective for small, cohesive ingroups.

### Optimist Camp: 5 para

Intergroup contact.  Realistic group conflict theory (functional interdepence between groups to reduce conflict.  Achieve a series of superordinate goals that neither group can achieve alone).



### Pessimist Camp: 5 para

This is a comittment problem.  Neither group can commit to cooperating, and each group only wants to cooperate if the other cooperates.  Solution is to impose high cost for defecting, usually through some third actor.


### Synthesize: 4 para

Comittment problem is a trust problem.  Interventions that increase intergroup trust should ameliorate comittment problems.

Trust can increase a two ways.  Group _leaders_ increase trust that the leader will punish defecting ingroup members.  Group members increase trust that outgroup members will not defect.  Not distinguishing between those ways and probably not mutually exclusive.

^[Simplest way to think about the problem in game-theoretic terms: one player & one stage game where P1 can cooperate or defect.  P1 has a belief about the type of P2; P2 has some probability of being a complier, conditional complier, or defector.  P1s payoffs for c/d depend on P2 type.  And the intervention increases P1's belief that P2 is conditional complier.  More complicated way is akin to Fearon's comittment problem.  Maybe has P2 signal its type to P1.  Intergroup contact allows for strong signal to P1.]

Negative contact increases prejudice more than positive contact decreases prejudice [@barlow2012contact]

# Notes

### General

Many conflict scholars see intergroup conflict as a bargaining game.  Conflict occurs because of a bargaining failure -- incorrect information [chris:cite], lack of trust that other group will honor comittments [@fearon; @powell].  The solution is a 3rd party -- another group, the state, social institutions like laws and customs -- powerful enough to compel both sides to honor their comittments.  Contracts & law are ways we can trust people without knowing them.  Large costs to defecting on our agreements help everyone trust that agreements will be kept.

But 3rd parties of this sort are not always possible.  Sometimes no state is strong enough to project power onto the conflicting groups.  Projecting power is expensive.  But groups do not necessarily need coercion to solve collective action problems.   Groups can develop social norms that constrain behavior, which are often more efficient than coercive appartus [@ostrom2015governing; @Ostrom2000evolution].  But sometimes social norms to solve conflict are not present or have broken down.

Intergroup contact is a solution to intergroup conflict from the psychological perspective.  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will reduce prejudice and the likelihood of violence by demystifying the outgroup, presenting the other group's perspective, and replacing imagined stereotypes with firsthand knowledge [@allport1954; @pettigrew2008does].  

Ostrom: grassroots norms. "a social norm, especially in a setting where there is communication between the parties, can work as well or nearly as well at generating cooperative behavior as an externally imposed set of rules and system of monitoring and sanctioning" [@ostrom2000evolution]

Comittment problems are trust problems: "the choice is not to trust, because the expectation is that the other player will not trust" [@ostrom2000evoluation]"

Ostrom on communication: "By devising simple, local mechanisms to get conflicts aired immediately and resolutions that are generally known in the community, the
number of conflicts that reduce trust can be reduced." [@ostrom2000evoluation]

Intergroup contact creates social institutions that affect/constrain behavior.

### Pessimist Camp

Some studies suggest that contact in these contexts might increase prejudice.   [Chris: Ryan Enos, Gubler, negative contact guy, Devine et al 2002, Devine 1989, Fiske 1989, Bhavnani et al 2014 is like Gubler, other Scacco theory citations].  Can direct intergroup contact overcome conflict and economic factors to reduce prejudice in places most in need of prejudice reduction?


### Optimist Camp

A notable exception is the @Scacco2016 study in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact.  That study also showed null effects for intergroup contact but negative effects for intragroup contact.  That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and the intervention sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

Allport thought behavioral consequence of prejudice was group violence.

From Scacco: "these interventions are driven by the premise that macrolevel peace and stability can be built from the ground up (Cárdenas 2013; Kuriansky 2007; Gasser and Levinsen 2004;Maoz 2000)."

Sidanius and Pratto 1999/2001 - social dominance theory

Violence requires justifying why the violence was okay.  Strong motivation to maintain negative attitudes.


We also want effects of intergroup contact for some ingroup members to diffuse to other ingroup members who have no contact.  The most prejudiced individuals will probably avoid contact, but if effects of contact from other ingroup members diffuse to these very prejudiced individuals -- either through vicarious/imagined contact or through social norm transmission -- intergroup contact could reduce prejudice even for individuals who do not engage in intergroup contact.


## Me

Bridging psychological and rationalist theories: still fundamentally a comittment problem.  But need to increase intergroup trust (belief that group will committ to agreement) and reduce intergroup prejudice (psychological benefit I get from hating the outgroup/feeling superior -- makes cost of conflict lower because adds some psychological benefit to conflict).  Strategic situation equation needs to adjust for psychological variables like trust and prejudice.

Overcoming comittment problem: Community leader involvement is very important -- leaders are often the ones bargaining, _and_ each side may trust that the other groups leaders can prevent/punish defections from his group.  Ingroup Policing.

# Moved from Intro

When both groups desire some valuable $X$ they must come to an agreement about the division of $X$ based on the existing strategic situation.  In dynamic settings where the strategic situation is unstable, groups cannot credibly commit to abide by their agrements; when the situation changes, one group will have an incentive to renege on the deal.  Bargaining breaks down because both sides know that neither can credibly commit to any bargaining agreement.  In the absence of a bargained solution groups use violence to settle disputes over $X$.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is a strong neutral third-party to solve the comittment problem by compelling each side to honor bargaining agreements.  This is an example of institutions constraining behavior.<!--Possibly next paragraph talks about government intervention over land use to compel each side.  But government is weak and unable to compel each sides; and pastoralists view the government as very partial to the farmers. -->

Intergroup violence is also considered a product of intergroup prejudice and dehumanization ^[cite: humanizing the outgroup stuff, @halperin2011emotional; also cite: tajfel, ].  Chris: argument.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is to reduce prejudice and humanize the outgroup; provide superordinate goals that show groups the benefit of working together.  

Even some proponents of the psychological perspective doubt the aility of intergroup contact to reduce violent conflict [@gubler; @saguy2011tension; others.]
