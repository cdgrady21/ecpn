# Theory: Intergroup Conflict as a Bargaining Problem
<!--Typical solutions strive to solve intergroup bargaining problem.  Information and comittment problems.  Define these problems.  Strong 3rd parties solve comittments problems by adding large costs to defecting on agreements.  Mediation works when it solves the information problem.  Bigger versions of "Intergroup conflict is often conceptualized as a bargaining problem" and "How can groups in conflict escape this spiral of distrust and conflict?" paragraphs from intro.-->

Intergroup conflict is most often conceptualized as a bargaining problem [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war], and most solutions to reducing intergroup conflict strive to help the groups overcome those bargaining problems [@di2017effectiveness; chris: this cite is just for peacekeeping/intervention].  Intergroup conflict is a bargaining problem because both groups want some resource -- land, power, etc -- but cannot reach an agreement about how to distribute that resource peacefully.  Because fighting is costly, the groups are better off reaching a bargained compromise and not fighting.  However, two bargaining problems prevent this: information problems and commitment problems.  To successfully bargain, the groups need (1) accurate information about each other, and/or (2) the assurance that each side will abide by its agreements.  

An _information problem_ arises because neither group possesses accurate information about the other, and both groups have an incentive to deceive the other in order to achieve an advantageous bargaining outcome.  Groups have an incentive to portray themselves as stronger, more willing to fight, and less willing to make concessions than they truly are [@fearon1995rationalist]. This causes bargaining failures because neither group knows what agreements the other side is willing to accept or what their side should receive from bargaining.  A _comittment problem_ arises because neither group can credibly commit to honor bargained agreements if bargaining power shifts in the future.  If bargaining power shifts, one side will have an incentive to renege on the status quo agreement to achieve a better agreement.  Neither group can commit to honor agreements made today when both groups know that bargaining power may shift tomorrow.[^bargainChange]  Without the ability to commit to agreements, bargaining will not be successful.

[^bargainChange]: Power between the groups can shift due to factors that affect each group's preferences and capabilities. Internally, one group may grow in power or size, one group may disarm before the other, the groups may have factions that reject the agreement, the groups may change leaders, or group members attitudes may change for other reasons.  Externally, the groups may gain or lose de facto or de jure state support, other external actors may switch allegiances, or some other shock may change each group's power relative to the other [@fearon2004civil; @reed2016bargaining; chris: need to cite and add more].  Anything that will change group power in the future can cause comittment problems in the present.

Groups in conflict overcome these bargaining problems in several ways.  Groups can overcome information problems through fighting, as they learn about each others capacity and willingness to fight [@smith2003mediation].  Groups can also overcome information problems through mediation.  An interested third party mediator with no stake in the conflict can provide accurate information to both sides, helping each side reach a bargain [@ott1972mediation; @kydd2006can; @beber2012international] <!--mediators also prevent groups from saying inflammatory things to each other [chris: forgot cite] -->  Even if groups overcome information problems, commitment problems could prevent groups from reaching an agreement.  The main way that groups overcome commitment problems is through strong third parties that add large costs to reneging on agreements [@fearon1998comittment; @powell2006war; @doyle2000international].  Though each group may have an incentive to defect on their agreement if bargaining power changes in a vacuum, the groups have no incentive to defect if a strong third party is capable and willing to punish defection from bargained agreements.  With a third party punishing defection, the groups can bargain in good faith knowing that the other will abide by its word.

<!--still left out: "In many conflicts, the conflicting groups are not united and therefore it is not clear who is involved in bargaining and who the external actor should punish if one side defects."-->

If we know how to resolve intergroup conflict, why does conflict persist?  International mediation and intervention are dogged by two issues of motivation.  First, mediators are often motivated for peace.  This motivation implies that mediator's provide information that is biased towards encouraging the groups to negotiate a peace agreement.  This means that peace-biased mediators do not solve information problems.  For mediators to reduce information problems, groups engaged in bargaining must believe that mediators provide accurate, unbiased information.  Since both groups know that mediators are biased towards peace, mediators may not help groups achieve peace [@smith2003mediation; @kydd2006can; @fey2010shuttle].  This same argument prevents mediators who are biased for or against disputants from solving information problems [@kydd2006can].[^mediation]

[^mediation]: Whether mediation is benefitted from biased or unbiased information is still a matter of debate.  Some scholars believe bias improves mediation.  The primary mechanisms proposed are that biased mediators are more likely to have relevant private information [@savun2008information] and that a biased mediator who tells his _favored_ group to compromise will be heeded [@kydd2003side; @svensson2009brings].  We tend to side with @beber2012international, @rauchhaus2006mediation, @crescenzi2011supply, and @kydd2006 and believe that unbiased mediation improves mediation outcomes.  @kydd2006can and @beber2012international provide compelling theoretical arguments: effective mediators must be both unbiased and motivated, but that motivation and bias often overlap.  We are also amenable to the argument of @fey2010shuttle that mediator success actually has less to do with information provision and more with agenda setting, offering carrots/threatening sticks, and serving as a backchannel.

Second, international actors may lack the motivation to mediate or to intervene into the conflict, even if one group reneges on its agreement.  Intervention is costly and many international actors either cannot credibly commit to intervene into many conflicts or have no interest in intervening into many conflicts [@kydd2006can; @fey2010shuttle; @beber2012international].  This lack of motivation is especially relevant for intergroup conflict between groups within a state.  Most international actors and strong third parties lack an incentive to intervene into intrastate intergroup conflicts, and these disputes tend to take place within states that lack the capacity to compel both sides themselves.  Since intervention is costly, strong third parties have an incentive to intervene only _after_ fighting escalates, so intervention will generally not be used to prevent conflict from escalating or to reduce the persistent, smaller-scale violence that plague many countries.  Where external actors are motivated to intervene, intervention is a short-term peace solution and its effects do not endure with the departure of the external actor [@rohner2013war; @beardsley2008agreement; @weinstein2005autonomous].  Once the external actor leaves, the groups' commitment problem returns: with no one to punish defection, the groups have no reason to trust each other.

Rather than rely on third parties to mediate or punish defection, groups in conflict can achieve peace by building mutual trust.  Reputations for trustworthiness are how groups overcome bargaining problems in the absence of formal enforcement mechanisms [@ostrom2000; @kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war; @ostrom2003trust].[^reputation]  Mutual trust overcomes bargaining problems because information and commitment problems are both, at their heart, problems of trust.  For information problems, groups do not trust the information they get from the other side.  For commitment problems, groups do not trust the other side to abide by its agreements.  Culativating a reputation as a trustworthy partner in previous interactions gives a bargaining partner confidence that you are trustworthy in the present interaction.

[^reputation]: Reputations based on previous behavior work because each group wants to be known as a trustworthy partner.  As a trustworthy partner, they are likely to (1) attract other trustworthy partners, and (2) elicit trusting behavior from partners.  Though defecting may be beneficial in one specific instance, getting a reputation for defection harms a group's ability to achieve agreements in the future.  By relying on reputation and the knowledge that groups desire good reputations, groups can coordinate in the absence of a strong third party.  The reputation argument is generally mobilized for contexts in which many groups observe the behavior of each other group.  Because there are many potential partners in the future, a good reputation has high payoff in the form of many potential cooperative partners in the future.  In our case, there are two main sides forming perceptions about the reputation of each other.  This closely mimics repeating prisoner's dilemma interactions as shown in @axelrod1980effective and @axelrod1980more.

<!--@ostrom2003trust ch.2 discusses how reciprocity, reputation, and trust help overcome selfish behavior that leads to pareto-inferior outcomes;  players achieve self-enforcing equilibria by comitting themselves to punishing noncooperators to deter noncooperation; repeated games & uncertainty about player types increases cooperation; face to face interaction increases cooperation bcuz increases trust, also could add subjective value to payoff structure, gives group ID, reinforces normes, not because players realize optimal strategies and not from non-face-to-face promises.  People seek to improve values they find important.  People use heuristics; people use internal evaluations that add or subtract from objective payoffs (+ for feeling good, - for being a sucker);    ch.12 discusses how trust is minimal in situations where reputations for trust cannot be established.  @hardin2003 ch.3 gaming trust -- concept of mutual trust: trust based on long-term interaction between two parties.

<!--@tam2007 intergroup prejudice = less likely to forgive, and forgiveness is a key to intergroup cooperation [@axelrod1980effective].  Prejudiced groups cannot put previous transgressions behind them.  @gutsell2010empathy people do not naturally feel empathy for outgroup members. 

Conflicting groups dehumanize the outgroup, meaning that they do not acknowledge the outgroup as fully human [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral].  Dehumanized groups are deemed unworthy of moral considerations; they do not deserve empathy, compassion, or fair treatment.  Along with not extending morality to outgroup members, ingroups often view of the outgroup themselves as immoral -- a group without values who cannot be trusted due to their innate moral deficiencies [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435].-->

However, groups in conflict are unlikely to build trusting relationships.  Intergroup conflict fuels and is fueled by intergroup prejudice, and prejudiced attitudes make peace difficult to attain [@allport1954prejudice; @sherif1958superordinate].  Groups in conflict dehumanize the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral], view the outgroup as innately immoral [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435], do not naturally feel empathy for outgroup members [@gutsell2010empathy], are unlikely to forgive outgroup transgression [@tam2007], and believe outgroup members to be untrustworthy and dishonest [@levine1972ethnocentrism; @eidelson2003dangerous].  With this set of prejudiced attitudes, outgroups are unlikely to develop reputations as trustworthy partners, even if both groups prefer mutual cooperation to war.  The groups are trapped in a mutually-defecting Prisoner's Dilemma.

## How Intergroup Prejudice Perpetuates Conflict

<!--How prejudice makes intergroup bargaining more difficult.-->

<!--Bigger version of these intro paragraphs: Increasing trust amidst conflict is difficult, however, for psychological reasons.  Group conflicts are often driven and perpetuated by intergroup animosity and prejudice long after the original grievance is forgotten [@mcdonnel2017graze; cite more about intergroup conflict & intergroup prejudice].  Intergroup animosity and intergroup prejudice can be insurmountable barriers to peace for direct and indirect reasons.  Directly, highly prejudiced groups are less likely to trust information they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from the other side.  In this way, prejudice directly inhibits intergroup bargaining and prevents peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Indirectly, prejudice biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup behavior, preventing each group from updating and improving their attitudes about the other.  Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent actions as defensive and justified, whereas behavior by outgroup members may be perceived as more threatening and more malicious than the same behavior committed by a neutral party [@hewstone1990ultimate; cite fundamental/ultimate attribution error, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, anchoring bias].  The perceived negative behavior may be seen as _defining_ of the group, whereas any perceived positive behavior may be seen as the _exception_ to the group [@allison1985group; @pettigrew1979ultimate].  This biased information processing reinforces negative group stereotypes and can subvert the groups' own attempts to foster peace.  It can also sabotage intergroup bargaining by causing the groups to have inaccurate beliefs about each other and each other's willingness to make peace, adding to information and commitment problems that cause conflict.

Groups in conflict develop attitudes that make peace difficult.  _The other is innately bad, the other cannot be trusted_.  Might get psychological benefits to positive group differentiation.  Social norms might encourage animosity and punish cooperation. Group members might receive social payoffs for harming the other group.  Biased assessment of actions: Outgroup Defense of self becomes violent assault, my violent assault becomes justified retribution. fundamental attribution error, motivated reasoning.  Bargaining of leaders impossible if group members hate each other -- both leaders know that the other guy cannot commit to controlling his group.  The model: two leaders bargaining and their groups having varying levels of cohesion.-->

Pre-existing intergroup prejudice prevents peaceful resolution of conflict in multiple ways.  First, and most obviously, prejudice directly exacerbates bargaining problems <!--chris: made this part of direct. "prejudice may change each group's preferences for peace and war" -->.  Second, prejudice biases perceptions of ingroup and outgroup behavior and preferences. <!--increases likelihood of misperceptions.  costs of misperceptions article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053118304642?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email -->

Intergroup prejudice prevents peace by directly exacerbating bargaining problems.  First, highly prejudiced groups are less likely to trust information they receive from the other side or any peace commitment they get from the other side.  Second, highly prejudiced groups may place psychological value on "beating" the other side [@ostrom2003trust; chris: this is really just a cite about internal evaluations generally].  As a result of these internal evaluations, any outcome in which the other side achieves _any_ utility could be viewed as a loss.  For thes direct reasons, prejudiced groups are less likely to successfully bargain and more likely to engage in violent conflict.<!--chris: need better discussion of internal evaluations -->

Prejudice also sabotages peace in indirect, pernicious ways.  Indirectly, intergroup prejudice prevents accurate perceptions about the attitudes and preferences of the outgroup. <!--Integrate next 3 paragraphs -->  Prejudice biases interpretation of ingroup and outgroup behavior.  Ingroups will perceive their own belligerent actions as defensive and justified, and are more likely to perceive outgroup actions as aggressive, negatively motivated, and unjustified [@hewstone1990ultimate; @amir1969contact; chris: fundamental attribution error, ultimate/group attribution error, confirmation bias, anchoring bias, Hunter et al 1991].  <!--If groups want to dislike each other, they will. Klein and Kunda, brewer1991/1999 -->  The perceived negative behavior may be seen as _defining_ of the group, whereas any perceived positive behavior may be seen as the _exception_ to the group [@allison1985group; @pettigrew1979ultimate].  Even positive intergroup interactions may be re-interpreted as negative to avoid cognitive dissonance [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @gubler2013humanizing; @paolini2010negative].  Interpreting interactions negatively saps the power of each group to reassure the other with costly signals of willingness to cooperate in future interactions [@kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war].  Adds to information problems as groups will hold inaccurate views about each other's willingness to cooperate and likelihood of upholding agreements.

<!--reputation as a mean of overcoming comittment problems when there is no third party.  How prejudice and biased interpretations of behavior prevent reputations from forming, even when both groups are the "complier" type.-->

Reputations, beliefs that groups have about the likely behavior of other actors, allow groups to bargain and negotiate even without an organization willing to punish defection from agreements.  

Many real-world situations are like an infinitely repeating game.  Gives each group the incentive to cooperate so that the other side will cooperate in the future[cite from PalBo2005].  But, as @axelrod1980 shows, perceived untrustworthy behavior by one side often begets a cycle of mistrust.




The reputation mechanism could prevent intergroup conflict but reputations, too, are hampered by prejudice.  <!--We tend to ascribe negative traits to outgroups and positive traits to ourselves [cite: ultimate/fundamental attribution error, tajfel1981, brewer1999; @amir1969contact; @brewer1991social].-->Prejudice biases interpretations of ingroup and outgroup behavior, which makes it very difficult for a group to develop a positive reputation with a group they are in conflict with, even when both groups are motivated to end the conflict.  This bias likely pushes each group's perception of the other side's willingness to make peace further from their true willingness to make peace and so reputations hinder, rather than aid, intergroup bargaining processes.

Reputations to prevent conflict are also hampered by a lack of opportunities for groups to observe each others behavior and to learn the outgroup's reputation.  Compounding that problem, few of the outgroup's interactions will be with groups that are relevant for predicting the outgroup's behavior towards my group.  This means that the main opportunity to observe outgroup behavior and learn their reputation is your own interactions with the outgroup.  For groups in conflict, these opportunities are likely rare and almost always adversarial.

<!--
(This also means that the outgroup has less incentive to cooperate with your ingroup because they are less likely to be punished for defecting in a world where reputation is built off of _experienced_ interactions, rather than previous _observed_ interactions. [chris: Scott Page's coursera on overcoming collective action problems cites a model where the more people who can see your interaction the more incentive you have to cooperate.].  Not sure this is relevant.) <!--Mediation can also be good when the groups are likely to say inflammatory things to each other.  Going through a mediator prevents that. chris: don't remember the citation, and this belongs in a diff section. -->

Indirectly, these negative attitudes also change the each groups preference for peace or war, both for leaders and for individuals who encounter disagreements with outgroup members. <!--chris: may want to hurt the other group -->  The utility an individual gets for attitudes and behaviors depends largely on how those attitudes and behaviors are received by their ingroup [@wood2000attitude].  These "social payoffs" constrain the actions of leaders and individual group members.  In the context of outgroup prejudice, the group might punish a leader for cooperating or compromising with the outgroup [@fearon1994domestic]<!--chris: domestic audience costs-->.  Individuals might get similarly socially punished for cooperating instead of taking a hard stand against the other side's perceived transgressions [@dreu2010social.  Leaders of highly prejudiced groups also cannot credibly commit to keep their group members in check.  Individuals in highly prejudiced groups might not engage in ingroup policing, a strong, costly signal to the other side that your group will uphold its peace agreements [@fearon1996explaining].  While cooperation and ingroup policing might be punished, aggressive actions may be seen as righteous self-defense of the ingroup and rewarded.  Groups that see the other side as immoral may receive some internal benefit from harming the outgroup [@weisel2015ingroup] 

Along with social benefits from aggressive attitudes and behavior, individuals might receive psychological benefits from conflict and from social differentiation with the outgroup [@wood2000attitude].  Many groups define "us" by positive differences with a "them", and an individual can derive self-esteem from positively comparing their group identity to a rival group [@tajfel1981groups; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup].  When group members derive self-esteem from feeling superior to an outgroup, group members may reject rhetoric about group similarity due to cognitive dissonance it causes them.  Group members may also reject actions that recognize the outgroup as equals.

<!--Wood's 2000 review of persuasion gave two additional functions of attitudes that apply to intergroup attitudes: self-concept and social adjustment [@wood2000attitude].  Self-concept refers to an individual's identity.  If an individual's identity is strongly related to ingroup superiority, she may not want to have better attitudes about the outgroup.  Social adjustment refers to an individual's desire to obtain social rewards.  If an individual's group opposes the outgroup and sanctions those who do not oppose the outgroup, she also has a strong reason to maintain negative outgroup attitudes.-->


## Psychological Reconciliation to Reduce Prejudice and Conflict (How to Reduce Prejudice and Why it Can Work)

<!--Bottom-up Psychological reconciliation, intergroup contact.  Define what it is, when it should work.-->

The problems of negative intergroup attitudes suggests that improving those attitudes could lead to peace-promoting behaviors and reduce conflict.  One of the most promising approaches to improving intergroup attitudes comes from intergroup contact theory.  Intergroup contact theory hypothesizes that interactions in which group members cooperate to achieve shared goals will reduce prejudice.  Reducing prejudice can help groups overcome bargaining problems and reduce the likelihood of violence.

Ingroup identification does not necessitate outgroup hate [@allport; @brewer1999; @halevy2008group]

When groups are in conflict, most incidental intergroup contact will be highly adversarial.  Intergroup contact theory posits several conditions necessary for intergroup contact to reduce prejudice.  Groups must cooperate with equal status to achieve shared goals with the support of elites.  Intergroup contact under these conditions gives the ability give strong costly signals about a group's reputation and the "group type" as a conditional complier: we will honor our agreements if you honor yours.  And about perceptual fairness/unbiasedness: we will interpret things you do fairly and we will interpret things we do fairly (i.e. we will not think everything we do is justified and everything you do is unjustified).

It is important for the intergroup contact to focus on superordinate goals [@sherif1954].

Groups need opportunity to signal trustworthiness and preferences for cooperation [@kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war]

<!--
Talk about ways this type of thing _could_ solve conflict.  Could solve information problem, could solve comittment problem.  Could encourage sharing/bargaining over resources instead of competition/conflict over resources.  Receive information directly, not from a mediator (who may be biased for one side or for peace).  Opportunities for costly signaling and ingroup policing/censuring [@ditlmann2017addressing; @Fearon1996].  Ingroup policing works because we cannot do things if our community dislikes those things.-->

<!--Could change stereotypes -- attributes that are applied to the outgroup, focusing on trustworthiness. Solving commit problem. Solve information problem.-->

Could improve reputations/remove stereotypes.  Increase perception of trustworthiness/intergroup trust.  Contact gives opportunity for costly signals.  Reputations will help groups overcome information and commitment problems.  Groups trust information they get from the other group.  Groups trust the other group to abide by agreements because they believe the other group is also motivated by peace.

Can give group members interactions that reduce perceptual biases.  Can decrease prejudice and encourage ingroup policing.  Decrease prejudice also allows leaders to credibly commit entire group to peace.  Encourage ingroup policing.  Create norms against prejudice and violence, or connect existing norms to the outgroup by humanizing the outgroup.

Could improve dispute resolution and reduce conflict over resources.  Encourage sharing resources _or_ separation of resources.  Mediation training -- help community leaders resolve disputes.

Could decrease threat, though in cases of active conflict this might exacerbate rather than solve conflict (information about reduced outgroup threat == higher chance of my group winning).

Could increase empathy.  Seeing the other side's argument, seeing their motivations. Increase empathy/less prejudice helps interpret information in non-biased way. [Chris: cite literature on empathy making me interpret information about other people more accurately.  Kertzer?]

Could expand ingroup/make group similarities salient.  Seeing our two groups as one, seeing our incentives as aligned.

Groups work together to gain more material resources, improves us now, makes me think working together in the _future_ would be good.

Can give group members the capacity to affect conflict.

As an alternative to top-down international intervention to reduce conflict, bottom-up peacebuilding programs can reduce conflict by focusing on both the immediate economic concerns contributing to conflict (superordinate goals?) and the psychological attitudes contributing to conflict. Bottom-up psychological reconciliation programs should work for the types of conflicts for which international intervention is rarely used and is unlikely to be successful.  Persistent intergroup conflict that plagues many countries.  Low-level conflict before it builds to large-scale conflict.  There are XX conflicts of this type accounting for XX deaths each year.

## Why Reducing Prejudice Could Fail

Yet reducing prejudice generally, and intergroup contact specifically, may not work in contexts of ongoing violence.  As with mediation and intervention, bottom-up reconciliation programs may be ineffective while conflict is going on and only effective at maintaining peace once the formal conflict has ended.  Many reasons contact may not work in this context.

Intergroup conflict is commitment problem solved by strong third party [@fearon1994ethnic; @powell2006war] and bottom-up programs do not provide a strong third party that can enforce commitments.  Psychological reconciliation is not how we've thought of solving commitment problems between conflicting groups or improving reputations.  Can psych reconciliation improve reputations in contexts of ongoing violence?  

Psychological reconciliation can prevent resumption of conflict but requires conflict to already be resolved [@bar2000intractable].  Active conflict produces many grievances and high prejudice; cognitive dissonance causes backlash for the most prejudiced people [@festinger1962cognitiveDissonance; @gubler2011diss].  Negative contact experiences reinforce negative stereotypes [@paolini2010negative]. Motivated reasoning for attitudes towards others [@klein1992motivated].  If you don't want to like someone, you will find a reason not to.

Underlying cause of conflict still present.  Groups still engage in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

Few norms against prejudice, possibly group norms that support this particular intergroup prejudice.  If intergroup contact works by activating "norms against prejudice", unlikely to work here.

Intergroup contact may only reduce prejudice from high-status group to low-status group.

Relative deprivation theory: the groups still see the other as responsbile for ingroup deprivations.

# Moved from Intro

When both groups desire some valuable $X$ they must come to an agreement about the division of $X$ based on the existing strategic situation.  In dynamic settings where the strategic situation is unstable, groups cannot credibly commit to abide by their agrements; when the situation changes, one group will have an incentive to renege on the deal.  Bargaining breaks down because both sides know that neither can credibly commit to any bargaining agreement.  In the absence of a bargained solution groups use violence to settle disputes over $X$.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is a strong neutral third-party to solve the comittment problem by compelling each side to honor bargaining agreements.  This is an example of institutions constraining behavior.<!--Possibly next paragraph talks about government intervention over land use to compel each side.  But government is weak and unable to compel each sides; and pastoralists view the government as very partial to the farmers. -->
<!--
Intergroup violence is also considered a product of intergroup prejudice and dehumanization ^[cite: humanizing the outgroup stuff, @halperin2011emotional; also cite: tajfel, ].  Chris: argument.  In this view, the solution to intergroup violence is to reduce prejudice and humanize the outgroup; provide superordinate goals that show groups the benefit of working together.  

Even some proponents of the psychological perspective doubt the ability of intergroup contact to reduce violent conflict [@gubler; @saguy2011tension; others.]
