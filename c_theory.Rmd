## Thinking

Big framing points/3 pills:

- Contact theory can be effective even if economic incentives opposed
- Contact theory can be effective even amidst an escalating conflict
- Most benefit to direct personal contact, but benefits diffuse to ingroup members with no personal contact.

## Theory Outline

### Pessimist Camp

Some studies suggest that contact in these contexts might increase prejudice.   [Chris: Ryan Enos, Gubler, negative contact guy, Devine et al 2002, Devine 1989, Fiske 1989, Bhavnani et al 2014 is like Gubler, other Scacco theory citations].  Can direct intergroup contact overcome conflict and economic factors to reduce prejudice in places most in need of prejudice reduction?


### Optimist Camp

A notable exception is the @Scacco2016 study in Kaduna, Nigeria, a city with a history of religious riots.  But that context does not mimic many aspects of a conflict context (frequent violence, zero-sum economic goods) that could influence intergroup attitudes and reduce the effects of contact.  That study also showed null effects for intergroup contact but negative effects for intragroup contact.  That was also not a peacebuilding program (social norms) and the intervention sought to diminish group affiliations, rather than highlight them -- salient group affiliations is an important component of intergroup contact.

Allport thought behavioral consequence of prejudice was group violence.

From Scacco: "these interventions are driven by the premise that macrolevel peace and stability can be built from the ground up (CÃ¡rdenas 2013; Kuriansky 2007; Gasser and Levinsen 2004;Maoz 2000)."

Sidanius and Pratto 1999/2001 - social dominance theory

Violence requires justifying why the violence was okay.  Strong motivation to maintain negative attitudes.


We also want effects of intergroup contact for some ingroup members to diffuse to other ingroup members who have no contact.  The most prejudiced individuals will probably avoid contact, but if effects of contact from other ingroup members diffuse to these very prejudiced individuals -- either through vicarious/imagined contact or through social norm transmission -- intergroup contact could reduce prejudice even for individuals who do not engage in intergroup contact.


## Me

Bridging psychological and rationalist theories: still fundamentally a comittment problem.  But need to increase intergroup trust (belief that group will committ to agreement) and reduce intergroup prejudice (psychological benefit I get from hating the outgroup/feeling superior -- makes cost of conflict lower because adds some psychological benefit to conflict).  Strategic situation equation needs to adjust for psychological variables like trust and prejudice.

Overcoming comittment problem: Community leader involvement is very important -- leaders are often the ones bargaining, _and_ each side may trust that the other groups leaders can prevent/punish defections from his group.  Ingroup Policing.
