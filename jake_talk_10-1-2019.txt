World Development Review: not been good about telling people on committee about what I've been doing.

Dissertation/Cara review/FunLab in two weeks: convince people it's valuable to use IR/rational choice frameworks + psych frameworks together to study conflict.
	- If unable to do so in that paper, then will write paper as a "does intergroup contact work when groups are fighting?  Might not because of history, animosity, distrust, etc...
	- Will ask Ekrem if he wants to work on a paper about the value of combining IR/rational choice + psych frameworks.
	- Jake thought: conincing ppl to think differently == have to ask yourself a lot what work each paragraph is doing.  "At this point in paper, you should be thinking THIS.  Now were gonna do THIS, not this other thing that you would be expecting."  There are a lot of good criticisms, but please criticize correctly.  Synthesizing theory from different traditions? Then say it.  Deploy strategic actor style theory based on psych microfoundations.  Then section on psych microfoundations, citing the psych people.  Start with _too many_ signposts and roadsigns and then remove them later.  Ppl have heuristics/top-down processes and if you aren't expecting, so need to convince people this is valuable and you gotta write so ppl will listen.

		- Perspectives on Politics for work that does not fit existing modes.
		- could also try to publish where formal theorists publish.
