# Key points

- Brief Nigeria's Middlebelt
    <!--- divides and blends country's north and south.  mix of religions, ethnicities, and occupations. [chris: not relevant, I think]-->
    - In recent years, violent conflict between farming and pastoral occupational groups have ravaged the region.  More than an occupational divide: cultural, ethnic, can be religious (Pastoralists are almost universally Muslim, farmers are a mix).  
    - farmers and pastoralists both need access to land for livelihoods.  The most recent conflict escalation, beginning roughly in 2014, has caused 7,000 deaths, displaced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  Economic damage unknown, but farmer-pastoralist conflict before the escalation costs Nigeria $13 billion annually in lost economic productivity [@council2019nigeria; @daniel2018anti; @mcdougal2015effect; @nyt2018nigeria].  Threatens Nigeria's food supply, since the Middle Belt is Nigeria's "food basket" and a key source of products like beef, dairy, yams, and cassava (https://qz.com/africa/1315749/nigeria-herdsmen-farmer-attacks-are-damaging-agriculture-economy/).  This violence has impeded food production and threatens to create a food shortage (Hailemariam 2018).
    - Before the latest surge in violence, the conflict was costing the Nigerian economy $13.7 billion a year (McDougal et al. 2015).
    - pop booms, migration, gov policy driving conflict
- lots of reasons contact might not be successful; trends pushing groups apart.
    - active & escalating conflict
    - fighting over livelihood resources
    - misaligned incentives with regards to those resources: Pastoralists want to graze, farmers do not want them to graze.
    - different ethnic groups and ways of life, often differ religious values
    - government favors one side
    - dehumanizing effects of killing other group
- Contact not change any of these causes of conflict; things that cause conflict also cause negative intergroup attitudes.
- Not completely misaligned interests.  Some complementarity, formerly working together: 
    - peace is in everyone's interest because fighting is costly.  Destroyed crops, stolen cattle, burned homes, murdered neighbors, constant fear and insecurity.
    - farmers have vegs/grains and need meat/milk.
    - farmers need manure and pastoralists need cow feed

# Context: Farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria's Middle Belt

Nigeria's Middle Belt is plagued by violent conflict over land use.  Farmers, who claim land for agricultural production, and pastoralists, who claim land for animal grazing, increasingly clash over claims to the same land.  Both groups depend on land for their livelihoods, but their divide is also cultural, ethnolinguistic, and, in some locations, religious.  The pastoralists are almost homogenously of the Fulani ethnic group, speak Fulfulde as their primary language, and practice Islam.  They maintain a semi-nomadic way of life, belonging to a home community while traversing vast distances to secure access to pastureland and water as seasons change.  The farmers live in sedentary villages and exploit land for agriculture.  The ethnic group, language, and religion change by village.  In our study, farmers came from more than a dozen ethnic groups, often residing in the same village.

Historically, these communities cooperated through trade and sharing land that was abundant relative to populations.  Pastoralists would graze their animals on crop residue after harvests and follow migration paths away from farmland during planting seasons.  The groups were complementary: pastoralists gained food for their animals and farmers gained animal manure/urine to replenish soil; farmers bought milk and meat from pastoralists and pastoralists bought grains and vegetables from farmers.  There were tensions, but these were typically overcome by negotiation and violence seems to have been rare.  The Middle Belt came to be known as Nigeria's "food basket" due to the abundance of foodstuffs coming out of the region, like beef, dairy, yam, and cassava^[https://qz.com/africa/1315749/nigeria-herdsmen-farmer-attacks-are-damaging-agriculture-economy/].  

In recent years, this relationship has been stressed by populations booms and climate change.  Nigeria's population at independence in 1960 was about 50 million; Nigeria's population in 2019 is estimated around 200 million.  At the same time, the Sahara's size expanded over 10%, decreasing land available for farming and grazing [@thomas2018sahara; @okpara2015conflicts].  As the number of farmers, pastoralists, and mouths to feed increased, the amount of land available to produce food declined.  These factors also pushed pastoralists southward, towards farming communities with whom the pastoralists had no pre-existing relationship.

Government policies perceived to favor farmers exacerbate things.

These stressors have sparked violent conflict between farmers and pastoralists in recent years [@unah2018nigeria]. The most recent conflict escalation, beginning roughly in 2014, has caused 7,000 deaths, displaced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.  Economic damage unknown, but farmer-pastoralist conflict before the escalation costs Nigeria $13 billion annually in lost economic productivity [@council2019nigeria; @daniel2018anti; @mcdougal2015effect; @nyt2018nigeria].  Sharing land is easier when people are scarce and land is plentiful; it is not so easy when land is scarce and people are plentiful.

Threatens Nigeria's food supply, since the Middle Belt is Nigeria's "food basket" and a key source of products like beef, dairy, yams, and cassava (https://qz.com/africa/1315749/nigeria-herdsmen-farmer-attacks-are-damaging-agriculture-economy/).  This violence has impeded food production and threatens to create a food shortage (Hailemariam 2018).

- Before the latest surge in violence, the conflict was costing the Nigerian economy $13.7 billion a year (McDougal et al. 2015).
- pop booms, migration, gov policy driving conflict




These tensions pose a tough test for intergroup contact to improve relations.

*****************




Climate change contributes to the conflict in two ways.  First, changing climate has reduced available water sources and land conducive to farming or grazing.  As the Sahara expands southward [@thomas2018sahara] and water sources dry [@okpara2015conflicts], farmers and pastoralists have to share fewer resources.  Second, changing climate pushes more pastoralists southward into the Middle Belt.^[In addition to the role of resource scarcity, @hoffmann2004role also suggests that southward transhumance by Tuareg groups pushes Fulani pastoralists further south.]  Their southward migration of pastoralists who formerly resided in northern Nigeria causes even more demand for land and water as those resources are becoming scarce.

Land scarcity is exacerbated by Nigeria's population boom.  Nigeria's population increased from 73 million people in 1980 to an estimated 200 million people in 2019.  The rapidly growing population means increased demand for farming and grazing land, simultaneous with the decreasing supply of farming and grazing land.  The dual pressures of increasing demand and decreasing supply have fueled farmer-pastoralist conflict in recent years [@unah2018nigeria].  Sharing land is easier when people are scarce and land is plentiful; it is not so easy when land is scarce and people are plentiful.

Land scarcity and new migrants jeopardize traditional agreements that have managed farmer-pastoralist interactions for decades.  Farmers and pastoralists residing in Nigeria's Middle Belt developed agreements about seasonal land sharing, exchanges for crop residue and animal manure, compensation for damage to crops by livestock, and other arrangements that helped them share resources and avoid conflict.  As land scarcity increased, these traditional agreements were increasingly broken [@cotula2004land; @kuusaana2015land].  These agreements were also less likely to be implemented by the pastoralists migrating into the Middle Belt, who were unaware of these agreements and not involved in forging them.  Their use of land beyond these traditional agreements has further ignited tensions.

Grievances related to access land and water points are compounded by government policies perceived to favor farmers.  Land privatization enacted in recent decades encouraged farmers to plant crops that occupy land continunously, like orchards, and effectively nullified farmer-pastoralist land sharing agreements [@bassett2009mobile].  Official cattle routes and reserves for moving herds are rarely enforced by the government, leading farmers to plant crops in once-protected areas, which further limits pastoralists’ available grazing space.  The “indigene versus settler” policy limits land ownership and other rights, including political representation, to certain ethnic groups in each state [@nigeria2014freedom].  Certain communities -- often pastoralists, who are seen as “settlers” -- are denied the right to run for public office, limiting the incorporation of their views into local policies.   

Compounding matters, the government of Benue State enacted an anti–open grazing law in November 2017, sparking more violence because many pastoralists reasonably viewed the law as biased against their way of life.  Benue mobilized state-sanctioned vigilante groups called "livestock guard" to enforce the law, but the livestock guard have sometimes sought out pastoralists, rather than guard farmland.[chris: @duru2018court benue police arresting livestock guard and benue courts releasing the guard; cite other news articles about livestock guard]

These factors -- climate change, increasing population, migration, and government policy -- have broken the agreements that previously governed interactions between farmers and pastoralists.  These factors have challenged the interdependence among the groups and the benefits and costs of reaching agreements.  As farmers in Nigeria began to raise their own livestock [@hoffmann2004role], the need for manure from pastoralists decreases.  As governments allocate private property to settled people, pastoralists increasingly destroy crops when using ancestral grazing routes.  And as demand for agriculture products rise, prices for crop destruction must increase to account for lost revenue.  These changes could seem like "defecting" on previous agreements, suggesting to each side that the other is untrustworthy.  Perceived untrustworthy behavior begets a cycle of distrust, culminating in the violent farmer-pastoralist conflict of recent years.

<!--The conflict is primarily _economic_ in nature -- groups fighting for land rights, with goals that are mainly local and territorial.  But these conflicts are exacerbated by ethnic and religious differences.-->

This persistent violence continues to have debilitating effects on Nigerians and the economy. First, it has taken many lives. In 2013 alone, Plateau, Kaduna, Nasarawa, and Benue states registered more than 100 incidents of violent conflict, accounting for more than 1,050 deaths (Mercy Corps 2018). The more recent violence left 300,000 displaced [@nyt2018nigeria] and more than 1,476 dead in 2018 [@council2019nigeria]. The Middle Belt is considered Nigeria’s “food basket” and is central to key value chains throughout the country, including beef, dairy, and cash crops such as cassava. This violence has impeded food production and threatens to create a food shortage [@frontera2018nigeria]. Before the latest surge in violence, the conflict was costing the Nigerian economy $13.7 billion a year [@mcdougal2015effect].  As one reporter noted, "The countryside is littered with the charred ruins of homes, schools, police stations, mosques and churches." [@mcdonnel2017graze].

Farmer-pastoralist conflict in the Middle Belt is not dissimilar from current and past conflicts in other parts of the world.  Throughout Sahel -- farmer-pastoralist clashes are a persistent problem throughout the Sahel and savannah areas of Africa, including Mali, the Ivory Coast (Bassett 1988, 2009), Niger (Thebaud and Batterbury 2001), and Ghana (Tonah 2002).  Farmer-pastoralist clashes are destabilizing to these countries politically, socially, and economically.  In South Sudan, Myanmar, Bosnia.  "Range wars" between farmers and ranchers in 19th and early 20th century American West.  Can learn about intergroup conflict generally from farmer-pastoralist conflict in Nigeria's Middle Belt.  These conflicts are primarily rural and the state does not project power to these areas.  It is often viewed as biased for or against one group.

<!--Summary-->

particularly hard case _because_ the conflict is very violent and escalating.  Also, the groups have a power disadvantage, their ways of life are different, fighting for land resources, also differ in ethnicity and sometimes religion.  BUT things work because there is a latent shared interest/identity to be activated.


## Intervention

The intervention formed mixed-group committees with equal numbers of farmers and pastoralists and provided them with funds to build infrastructure that would benefit both communities; committees then collaboratively chose and constructed infrastructure projects.  It started with a series of community meetings, beginning with separate farmer and pastoralist meetings that built up to joint decision-making meetings with the two groups together.  Each joint project committee included an even number of farmers and pastoralists, as well as women and youth representatives, and totaled between 12 and 15 members. Each committee received two grants, one for quick-impact projects, of approximately \$2,000, and one for joint projects, of approximately \$25,000.

The quick-impact projects were conceived as a trust-building initiative, intended to let community members see that cooperation was possible. Projects, managed by both farmers and pastoralists, included hand pumps, construction or rehabilitation of market stalls and schools, rehabilitation of health centers, and construction of fences along grazing routes to protect farmlands. The joint economic development projects aimed to address an underlying issue related to the conflict: sharing of resources that impact livelihoods. Pollution of water, affecting both farming and livestock, was the primary issue people raised. As a result, each site received a new borehole well, with farmer and pastoralist youth helping to construct the wells.  

The program also provided mediation training to each community's leaders and held forums where the groups discussed the underlying drivers of conflict.

These projects were designed with the conditions of Contact Theory in mind.  Groups (1) cooperated with (2) equal status to achieve (3) shared goals with (4) support of local authorities.  These projects were meant to help the groups solve some underlying resource problems that drove conflict.  Collectively, these project give groups the opportunity so send costly signals about their willingness to cooperate [@kydd2000trust, @rohner2013war].

Will these cooperative interactions allow each group to trust the other?

To prevent negative contact interventions, Mercy Corps spent months preparing groups for the idea of working together.

To ensure support of authorities, community leaders were involved in the projects.

<!--
Dehumanization of killing: 
- Conflicting groups dehumanize the outgroup, meaning that they do not acknowledge the outgroup as fully human [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral].  Dehumanized groups are deemed unworthy of moral considerations; they do not deserve empathy, compassion, or fair treatment.  Along with not extending morality to outgroup members, ingroups often view of the outgroup themselves as immoral -- a group without values who cannot be trusted due to their innate moral deficiencies [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435].  Killing members of the other group causes further dehumanization.
