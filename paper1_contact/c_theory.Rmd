Things to fit in: History of conflict -- not imagined disputes. More about perceived deservingness (right now minutely in there as part of psyc phenomena increasing information problems).  More on cognitive dissonance?

Loss aversion: a negotiated deal == give up something, gain something.  We weigh losses more than gains (ross and ward 1995 psych barriers)

Definition of intergroup conflict (Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013): "Intergroup conflict involves competition for dominance between two or more groups over physical resources, values, and/or claims to status and power (Coser, 1967). Conflict can usefully be thought of as occurring along a continuum. At one end of the spectrum, conflict can manifest as prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination and can
be subtle or take more explicit forms. At the other end of the spectrum, conflict can become both overt and violent and take the form of “ethnic cleansing” and genocide (Fisher, 1994, p. 47).

# Theory: Improving Intergroup Relations Through Cooperative Intergroup Contact

<!--Summary of argument: 

Contact summary.  Contact mainly tested in lab between minimally different groups. Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion.  Mechanisms through which contact works difficult when groups have a lot of animosity, history of conflict, etc.  List reasons why difficult.  Then list some reasons why it still would work: achieving common goal, shows that groups can benefit from cooperation.-->

Cooperative intergroup contact has long been posited as a means to improve intergroup relations.  Initially presented by Gordon @allport1954prejudice, the contact hypothesis assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup animosity.  Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes will misrepresent groups and create imagined differences between ingroup and outgroup members. To remove these negative stereotypes new experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup.

Allport and subsequent authors specified four conditions under which contact will remove stereotypes and improve intergroup relations.  First, the contact must involve ongoing personal interaction between members of both groups.  Second, both groups must have equal status in the interaction.  Third, the interaction must involve cooperation towards a common goal.  And fourth, the intergroup interaction must have the support of institutions and authorities.

Contact is said to work through four main mechanisms.  The first is an informational mechanism wherein direct experience with outgroup members allows members of each group to see how similar they are and overrides negative stereotypes [@allport1954prejudice].  The second and third are emotional mechanisms.  Intergroup contact reduces the feelings of threat and anxiety that arise from fear of the unknown [@stephan1985intergroup; @page2008little]; intergroup contact also enables empathy so that ingroup members understand the perspective of the outgroup [@batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably].  The fourth is a social categorization mechanism wherein frequent interactions with outgroup members makes salient a shared identity based on the groups' similarities and shared interests [@gaertner1993common; @gaertner2014reducing].  Personal interaction with specific outgroup members then generalize to the entire outgroup if the specific outgroup members are typical of the outgroup (their behavior tells you about the behavior of other outgroup members) [@hewstone1996contact].
<!--this all supposes groups have overlapping preferences, don't want to hurt each other, are really nice people, etc.  None of that applies to most groups in conflict.  Ekrem: "Rational agents have 100% empathy, but they still fight." (rational agents know what the other guy will do == empathy as it is defined). -->
<!--
    - Knowledge effect: experience with outgroup replaces misperceptions and stereotypes.  Hear their perspective and understand point of view == less prejudice & no longer attribute negative motivations to the outgroup. [@allport1954prejudice]
    - Expand ingroup to include the former outgroup [@gaertner2014reducing].  Contact can make salient many similarities between the groups, reducing feelings of social distance and even helping to craft a joint identity that encompasses both groups.
    - Reduce anxiety, uncertainty, and threat [@lee2001mere; @page2008little; @paolini2004effects; @pettigrew2008does].  Feelings of threat and anxiety often arise from fear of the unknown, and feelings of threat and anxiety reduce as familiarity with outgroup members increases [@page2008little; paolini et al 2004; lee 2001].
    - Increase perspective taking/empathy for outgroup [@pettigrew2008does; @broockman2016durably]
-->
<!--
-Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013 definitions:
    - Intergroup anxiety refers to the feelings of discomfort and nervousness that arise in intergroup encounters.
    - Empathy refers to the ability to share and understand another person’s feelings. It is the process involved when we speak of “putting yourself in another’s shoes.”
    - Knowledge: Allport (1954) wrote that intergroup contact leads intergroup actors to learn more about their respective outgroups, and this new knowledge can lead to a reduction in prejudice. Pettigrew and Tropp (2008) have argued that an emphasis on knowledge in the sense of “getting to know one another” can take the form of bringing people together in order to realize their mutual similarities, which runs the risk of ignoring important and defining group differences.
-->

These mechanisms support the reduction of stereotypes for individuals involved in the intergroup interaction.  Since it is not feasible for all members of two groups to interact, the positive effects of contact must diffuse to individuals not involved in the interaction for intergroup contact to meaningfully improve intergroup relations.  This diffusion to other group members occurs via indirect contact, and indirect contact can occur in two ways.  First is the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members, either through word of mouth or through observing positive intergroup interactions [@wright1997extended].  The second is changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual].<!--^[Though the mechanisms through which indirect contact improves attitudes is beyond the scope of this paper, @vezzali2014indirect suggests that anxiety reduction mediates the effects of direct and indirect contact.  Social cognitive theory, which is the theoretical backing of vicarious contact, suggests that individuals adopt behaviors and attitudes that they observe; specifically, when they believe those observed behaviors and attitudes will help them achieve their goals [@Bandura1971], such as fitting in with their group.]-->

### Why intergroup relations might not improve

<!--To understand why cooperative contact might not work for groups in conflict, we must specify the mechanisms through which contact works and then specify why contextual factors/conditions somehow block/prevent that mechanism.-->

The mechanisms through which contact improves an individual's negative outgroup attitudes assume that the negative attitudes are caused by a lack of experience with the other side.  The information mechanism says that contact allows for personal experiences that override the stereotypes that arise when individuals have little experience with outgroup members.  The anxiety-reduction mechanism says that contact reduces the anxiety that individuals naturally feel towards the unknown.  The perspective-taking mechanism says that contact allows individuals to understand the feelings of the other side, which they could not do due to lack of experience with the other side.  And the ingroup categorization mechanism says that contact can reveal or make salient similarities and shared interests that were not apparent before contact.   

While a lack of experience may contribute to negative outgroup attitudes, grievances, competition, and conflicting interests also likely contribute to negative outgroup attitudes, especially for groups in violent conflicts.  In the case where animosity is caused by conflicting interests, learning about the other side may instead reveal misaligned interests, confirm that the other side is threatening, rather than dispel negative stereotypes and reduce anxiety.  Empathy/perspective-taking should not improve relations if the other side is expected to be belligerent [@kertzer2018empathy], and few shared interests make group recategorization unlikely.  Intergroup contact was not originally formulated as a way of improving intergroup relations when interests conflicting; it was originally formulated as a way to diminish prejudice, which @allport1954 differentiated from justified negative feelings towards an "actual menace" (p.8).  Subsequent scholars have noted that intergrop contact may not improve group relations if the groups have genuine conflicts of interests [@forbes1997ethnic; @hewstone1996contact].
<!--
But information from personal experience with the other side will not decrease animosity when it is probably true that some members of the other side want to cause physical harm to your side.

Superordinate identities unlikely for groups in violent conflict, who will have few shared identities and whose material interests are opposed.-->

Not all intergroup contact decreases animosity. Negative intergroup interactions lead to more negative attitudes towards outgroup members [@paolini2010negative; @enos2014causal; @condra2019casual], and are most likely to occur for individuals with the most negative outgroup attitudes [@gubler2011diss; @plant2001responses].  Groups in conflict more likely than others to have negative contact experiences.  incidental contact can make things worse (the @enos2014causal cite and the @forbes1997ethnic cite; vanhanen 1999

Even well-structured positive interactions can increase negative attitudes by causing cognitive dissonance in prejudiced individuals, which causes them to cling more strongly to their prejudicial beliefs (Gubler 2011).  Groups in conflict more likely than others to have strong, stable, negative opinions towards the outgroup.

Negative intergroup interactions worsen intergroup relations and 

Groups in conflict or with a history of conflict likely have strong, stable, negative attitudes.

Moreover, contact can only meaningfully improve group relations -- as opposed to improving interpersonal relations between a few members of opposing groups -- if several conditions are met.  First, cooperative contact with some outgroup members must cause ingroup members to update their beliefs about the entire outgroup, not just the outgroup members with whom the ingroup members interacted.  Second, the newly positive attitudes of ingroup members who interacted with outgroup members must diffuse to other ingroup members.  And third, cooperative contact must impact both grups, even if there are existing power asymmetries.  Due to opposing group interests, negative experiences, existing grievances, and power differentials, groups involved in violent conflict may not meet these conditions.  




Conflicting groups dehumanize the outgroup, meaning that they do not acknowledge the outgroup as fully human [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral].  Dehumanized groups are deemed unworthy of moral considerations; they do not deserve empathy, compassion, or fair treatment.  Along with not extending morality to outgroup members, ingroups often view of the outgroup themselves as immoral -- a group without values who cannot be trusted due to their innate moral deficiencies [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435].  Killing members of the other group causes further dehumanization.

<!--
    - Contact supposed to work through information/dispel stereotypes and update to entire group.  But it is true that some members of the other side want to and have caused physical harm to members of your group.
    - Or empathy, which seems to apply to disadvantaged groups [@brockman] but not groups in conflict.
    - ingroup expansion, which is unlikely for real groups living apart in separate communities.
    - reduced anxiety/threat felt, which is also apply to groups in conflict.  There still exist members of that group who are threatening.

    - Personal history/experience with violence
    - Continuing violence == continuing grievances to blame on other side
-->


**Conditions under which contact works are not present**

Conditions under which contact is positive might not be possible.  Equal status in interactions -- if groups have unequal status in life, how can any interactions be with equal status?  Institutional support maybe for interactions in the contact setting, where interaction is to achieve a goal that both sides have.  But will that institutional support extend to contact in other settings?  And if institutions/authorities have animosity, will norms of tolerance emerge?  

Contact under other conditions -- such as incidental contact, intergroup competition, interactions in which one group has power over the other, elite disapproval of intergroup contact -- is unlikely to improve intergroup relations [@enos2014causal; @forbes1997ethnic] habyarimana et al 2007; vanhanen 1999.]  This concern is heightened for groups in conflict whose incidental interactions are likely antagonistic. **[chris: maybe don't need this here.  Could go in next section]**


**Conditions under which positive attitudes generalize and diffuse are not present**

Conditions must be met for intergroup contact to improve intergroup relations and reduce violent conflict.  First, ingroup members must generalize their contact with a few outgroup members to the entire outgroup.  Second, the positive effects of contact must diffuse throughout the ingroup.  Third, attitudes of both groups must improve.  Even if contact effectively changes the attitudes of individual group members, contact cannot have meaningful effects on reducing violent conflict unless these conditions are met.

These conditions may not be met by groups engaged in violent conflict.  First, ingroup members who cooperate with outgroup members may not perceive those outgroup members as typical of the outgroup due to previous negative experiences with outgroup members; consequently, ingroup members may not use interactions with those outgroup members to update their attitudes about the outgroup as a whole.  Second, even if contact changes the attitudes of ingroup members who experience contact, norms that affect other ingroup members may not develop.  Liking other group hard to link to a positive ingroup trait, like morality.  Third, cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.

@ditlmann2016can contact-based intervention did not affect the disadvantaged, minority group.

<!--
Typicality
Group Status

Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013: "For example, when groups have a history of intergroup tension and animosity, group salience and perceived typicality of outgroup members may lead to more prejudice against individual outgroup members and their group as a whole."
-->

<!--Many studies suggest intergroup contact only improves the attitudes of the majority/dominant group.  Jews, not Arabs.  White people, not black people.  Minority group has lots of experience with majority group?  Culture does not assign negative traits to majority group because "culture" is dictated by majority?-->

**Contact does not change cause of conflict**

Real world violence caused by real world problems.  These groups have misaligned incentives.  Literatures in psych, IR, and econ that predict no change after intergroup contact because groups incentives still fundamentally misaligned.  Pastoralists want to graze, farmers do not want them to graze.  Contact not change the fundamental causes of conflict; things that cause conflict also cause negative intergroup attitudes.  Could get peace through negotiation, but no bargaining range.  Could get peace through negotiation, but cannot trust all group members to abide by deal.

Group animosity often arises due to the competition for resources that both groups claim or desire [@sherif1958superordinate].  If competition for resources itself causes poor intergroup relations/negative intergroup attitudes, then competition for resources will cause conflict and intergroup contact will have no effect because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.  With or without structured intergroup contact, the groups are still engaged in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

This concern is heightened for groups in active conflict.  Their negative intergroup attitudes come from real conflict, not the type of prejudice that Allport and others theorized about.  Through contact, you might learn that the other group _does_ favor itself. Learning about the other side is not going to improve relations if incentives are completely misaligned and the other side _does_ want to harm you [@kertzer2018empathy].  Additionally, in contexts of ongoing conflict, there may be few norms against prejudice, and possibly group norms that support this particular intergroup prejudice.  If intergroup contact works by activating "norms against prejudice", contact is unlikely to have an effect for groups in conflict.

**Summary**

The contact hypothesis was devised to explain racial animus in the United States.  It's mechanisms address problems that arise due to lack of experience: replacement of incorrect stereotypes, reduced anxiety due to uncertainty, ability to see things from outgroup's perspective, and seeing a shared identity with the outgroup.  The contact hypothesis is almost always tested on groups who are spatially segregated and have limited opportunities for interaction -- white people and black people, Muslims and Christians, Jews and Arabs^[chris: do Jews and Arabs fit into this?].  These mechanisms may not function for groups with a recent history of negative and violent interaction.  How would contact improve attitudes when negative attitudes are based on negative experience, rather than inexperience?

<!--
Typicality: when interacting with the outgroup makes one atypical, how to generalize?  "Typicality" == outgroup member perceived to be typical of group.  Previous negative experience about group == individuals less likely to believe positive experiences with outgroup member are "typical" and so less likely to update about the outgroup; more likely to have good feelings only about the particular people with whom they interact.  even when positive interactions improve attitudes for the individuals who are interacting, the improved attitudes may not be generalized to the outgroup (Doosje et al 1995).  
-->
<!--
- Reason not to update about whole group, just particular people

-->

<!--
even when positive interactions improve attitudes for the individuals who are interacting, the improved attitudes may not be generalized to the outgroup (Doosje et al 1995).

Some evidence that contact only effects the majority/dominant group.  Because the minority/non-dominant group already has a lot of interaction with dominant?  Because minority actually has things to fear?  Regardless, cooperative contact will not meaningfully reduce violent conflict unless it improves attitudes for both sides of the conflict.
-->

## How contact can improve relations even amid conflict

Provide opportunities for interaction.  Structure interaction in a way that avoids misperceptions.  Show that working together is possible and advantageous.

How would intergroup contact work amid conflict?  Key condition: cooperation towards a joint goal.  Contact provides opportunities for each group to see that working together helps each group achieve their goals.  Humans are goal-driven.  In a lab experiment, @grady2019contact suggests that cooperative contact only improves attitudes towards the outgroup if the cooperation achieve its objective.

intergroup contact can show that working together is materially beneficial for both groups, associates intergroup cooperation with positive material outcomes.  By cooperating for joint benefit in the present groups can see how cooperative behavior in the future will benefit both groups.  Intergroup contact often entails reciprocal exchanges like trade, which can provide tangible evidence that both groups are materially better off cooperating than fighting [@rohner2013war].

Similar to @kydd costly signal: assure other side that working together will be good.

Also applies to indirect contact: have to hear about or observe contact going well to want contact with the other side.

@jha2013trade: interethnic trade that benefitted both parties created norms of interethnic cooperation; those norms continued to have effects centuries later.

These groups don't _really_ have misaligned incentives.  Can complement each other: farmers provide crop residue, pastoralists provide manure; farmers provide grains & vegetables, pastoralists provide milk and meat.

_Cooperative contact reveals group-level benefit, so group members put pressure on other group members to cooperate._

But the animosity between groups can be driven by opposing interests and negative experiences as much as inexperience.  When there is a latent shared interest to be activated/made salient, contact helps reveal that latent shared interest.  Violent past and present, group differences, group animosity, Something that group animosity is preventing the groups from seeing.   Contact should work when there is a latent shared interest to activate.  Mechanisms of contact show how shared interest exists.  

Contact removes barriers to identifying shared itnersts.  Hard to believe there is a shared interest while holding negative stereotypes about the other group, such as their lack of trustworthiness and their ingroup favoritism.  Hard to see a shared interest when interacting with the other group causes anxiety due to feelings of threat.  Hard to see a shared interest when you do not identify any shared identities.  Contact removes these barriers.


- Contact as opportunity to show that intergroup cooperation is materially good for both groups.
    - Related: contact to foster trade? [@rohner2013war] (Jha and Shayo 2019 - Valuing Peace).

- Contact as opportunity to send costly signal of type: trustworthy, fair, hard-working.

- Contact to create norm of ingroup policing.

- Contact increases likelihood of peace through negotiation:
    - opportunity to find bargaining range
    - opportunity ot build trust that both groups will abide by deal, sanction ingroup members who defect.

Chris: Remind self not to bring up things I provide no evidence for.

<!--
Contact and Allport's conditions: maybe not about the conditions, but about beliefs that cooperation/interaction with the outgroup will help individuals achieve their goals.  People are goal-oriented, with material, social/status, psychological/internalized moral, and evolutionary goals. People do things to achieve those goals.  People like things that help them achieve their goals.  If intergroup cooperation leads to positive outcomes, I will do more of it and I will like that group.

Interacting with some other group with equal status == likely that my opinions/desires taken into account, whereas unequal status == my opinions/desires are subordinated.  Institutional support == likely that social norms are on my side.  No institutional support == very possible that social norms are not on my side.  Common goals == group working on something that is good for me and good for them; can trust them to work on it, too.

Conflict as a collective action problem: both groups better off cooperating but have incentives to defect.  How do we usually solve collective action problems?

## Summary

[If needed, summary of argument.]

## Hypotheses

Separate families of Competing hypotheses.

Hyp 1: Contact good.

Hyp 2: Contact bad/neutral.

<!--

***********

Left out "in the literature" mechanisms through which contact can affect intergroup attitudes.
    - Social norms and extrinsic motivation [@yablon2012we]
    - ingroup policing [@moussa2018overcome; @ditlmann2016can; @fearon1996explaining]
    - mutual interest [@moussa2018overcome.  also realistic group conflict?]

Can encourage ingroup policing [@ditlmann2017addressing; @Fearon1996].  Ingroup policing works because we cannot do things if our community dislikes those things.  Decrease negative affect allows leaders to credibly commit entire group to peace.  Encourage ingroup policing.

**Changing attitudes about outgroups**: Wood's 2000 review of persuasion gave two additional functions of attitudes that apply to intergroup attitudes: self-concept and social adjustment [@wood2000attitude].  Self-concept refers to an individual's identity.  If an individual's identity is strongly related to ingroup superiority, she may not want to have better attitudes about the outgroup.  Social adjustment refers to an individual's desire to obtain social rewards.  If an individual's group opposes the outgroup and sanctions those who do not oppose the outgroup, she also has a strong reason to maintain negative outgroup attitudes.
