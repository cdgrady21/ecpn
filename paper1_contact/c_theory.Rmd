# Improving Intergroup Relations Through Cooperative Intergroup Contact

<!--Section goal:  Contact summary + conditions.  Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion.  How contact generalizes/diffuses.  THEN ME: overarching understanding of contact and when it should/should not work.-->

<!--Contact summary + conditions -->

Cooperative intergroup contact has long been posited as a means to improve intergroup relations.  Popularized by Gordon @allport1954prejudice, the contact hypothesis assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup animosity.  Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes will misrepresent groups and create imagined differences between ingroup and outgroup members. To remove these negative stereotypes new experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup.

Allport and subsequent authors specified four conditions under which contact will remove stereotypes and improve intergroup relations.  First, the contact must involve ongoing personal interaction between members of both groups.  Second, both groups must have equal status in the interaction.  Third, the interaction must involve cooperation towards a common goal.  And fourth, the intergroup interaction must have the support of institutions and authorities.  Allport argued that contact works by enhancing knowledge and overriding negative stereotypes about the outgroup.

<!--Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion. -->
In addition to enhancing knowledge, subsequent scholarship has identified three additional mechanisms through which contact reduces prejudice.  First, contact reduces the feelings of threat and anxiety that arise from fear of the unknown [@stephan1985intergroup; @page2008little].  Second, contact enables perspective-taking so that ingroup members empathize with the outgroup [@batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably].  And third, contact makes salient a shared identity based on the groups' similarities [@gaertner1993common; @gaertner2014reducing].  These mechanisms support the reduction of prejudice for individuals involved in the intergroup interaction, but the positive effects of contact must diffuse to individuals not involved in the interaction for intergroup contact to meaningfully improve intergroup relations.  This diffusion to other group members occurs through changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual] and through the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members [@wright1997extended].

<!--Here is the overarching undestanding of contact/common thread; here is what it means for when contact should work and when contact should not.
- cannot think cooperation will be in the group's interest if the other side is untrustworthy and immoral (stereotypes), threatening (threat/anxiety), 
-->
Taken together, the existing literature suggests that cooperative contact improves intergroup relations when it reveals that the groups have latent shared interests, and that these interests remain latent due to psychological barriers -- negative stereotypes, feelings of outgroup threat, a lack of empathy, and a lack of perceived similarities -- to identifying shared interests.  <!--These barriers prevent groups from identifying their shared interests by providing motivation to maintain negative beliefs [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning] and biasing perceptions of the other side [@ward1997naive].  -->Cooperative contact provides an obvious example of a shared interest in the common goal that both groups work towards, and it removes those psychological barriers to identifying shared interest by overriding stereotypes, reducing anxiety, presenting the other side's perspective, and demonstrating cross-group commonalities.  <!--In short, cooperative contact provides an example of a shared interest and removes the barriers to groups identifying shared interests.-->

Cooperative contact also provides opportunities for indirect learning about the outgroup, which improves attitudes even for group members who do not engage in contact.  Indirect learning about the outgroup through knowledge of cross-group interaction and social norms shows that cross-group interaction is safe and socially encouraged, especially if cooperation is deemed beneficial to the ingroup [@ditlmann2017addressing; @fearon1996explaining].  Awareness of cross-group cooperation also creates the expectation of future interaction with outgroup members, and that expectation motivates individuals to see the outgroup more positively [@klein1992motivated; @van2019actions].  Through indirect learning cooperative contact improves attitudes even for ingroup members with no cross-group contact.

## Cooperative intergroup contact in the context of violent group conflict

Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact to improve attitudes.  Individuals participating in violent group conflict hold negative attitudes about the other side, and cooperative contact provides them with positive, dissonant information about their adversary.  Improving attitudes requires the rejection of the pre-existing negative attitude for dissonant positive attitude [@gubler2013humanizing].  Cooperative contact is meant to reveal commonalities, but violent conflict occurs due to a conflict of interests, highlights those conflicting interests, and creates further conflicting interests.  Instead of commonalities, contact between these groups may reinforce reasons to fight.  

Where commonalities are present, they may not be identified because of two psychological biases: motivated reasoning and cognitive dissonance [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning; @festinger1962cognitiveDissonance].  Groups justify perpetrating violence by dehumanizing the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization], and group members must maintain that dehumanization or come to terms with their transgressions.  Individual's maintain their negative attitudes in two ways.  First, individuals will perceive cross-group interactions negatively so that those interactions conform to pre-existing beliefs about the outgroup.  Second, individuals will notice and remember negative interactions that conform to pre-existing views of the outgroup, biasing perceptions of the other side [@ward1997naive].  If an individual's cross-group experience does not correspond to pre-exiting beliefs about the outgroup, the resulting psychological discomfort and cognitive dissonance can cause a backlash and worsen attitudes [@gubler2013humanizing].

Violent conflict could also block the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.  Contact is meant to work through reducing stereotypes, creating empathy, reducing threat, and revealing common identities.  But contexts of violence offer plentiful examples that reinforce negative stereotypes about the outgroup, and groups create narratives that support those stereotypes [@bar2017development].  Empathy, the ability to take the perspective of the other side, will not improve cross-group relations if taking their perspective reveals incentives to be belligerent [@kertzer2018empathy].  When outgroup members are a genuine threat learning about the outgroup through contact may confirm that they pose a threat, rather than reduce anxiety.  And far from revealing common identities, violence leads to the construction of opposing group identities and reinforces group differences [@fearon2000violence].  For these reasons, violent conflict may override the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.

Even if intergroup contact created cross-group friendships for the individuals cooperating, aspects of violent contexts may block generalization of those attitudes to other outgroup members.  Groups in conflict have limited contact, so any outgroup member engaging in contact my be viewed as atypical and not informative about other outgroup members [@doosje1995bad].  Conditions of conflict environments may also prevent from indirectly extending to ingroup members without contact.  Conflicting groups share emotions of outgroup prejudice and norms that delegitimize the outgroup [@bar2017development].  With pre-existing norms that reinforce negative attitudes, cooperative norms that reach all ingroup members are unlikely to form.  These pre-existing norms may also discourage ingroup members with positive attitudes from displaying those attitudes, either through talking about or engaging in cross-group interaction publicly.  With no opportunities to hear about or observe positive cross-group interaction, the effects of contact cannot extend to ingroup members without contact.  

But these barriers do not mean that contact cannot improve intergroup relations for groups in violent conflict.  Cooperative contact should improve attitudes towards the outgroup when there exists a latent shared interest to make salient, and conflicting groups share an interest in obtaining peace because fighting is costly [@fearon1995rationalist].  Violence can obfuscate these shared interests latent, but contact can activate them by providing groups with an example of a shared interest that can be reached through cooperation and removing the psychological barriers to identifying shared interests.  Successful cross-group cooperation can generate cooperative social norms that indirectly improve attitudes for group members, even those who do not engage in direct contact.

<!--Summary -->
<!--Cooperative contact should improve attitudes towards the outgroup when there exists a latent shared interest to make salient.  Shared interests may remain latent because psychological biases prevent groups from identifying opportunities for both groups to benefit from cooperation.  Cooperative contact can help group members identify shared interests, and cooperative social norms can arise when groups identify that cross-group cooperation is good for the group.  However, when groups have no latent shared interests, contact is unlikely to improve group relations.-->

<!--
Why mechs are about lack of experience.
- The mechanisms through which contact improves an individual's negative outgroup attitudes assume that the negative attitudes are caused by a lack of experience with the other side.  The information mechanism says that contact allows for personal experiences that override the stereotypes that arise when individuals have little experience with outgroup members.  The anxiety-reduction mechanism says that contact reduces the anxiety that individuals naturally feel towards the unknown.  The perspective-taking mechanism says that contact allows individuals to understand the feelings of the other side, which they could not do due to lack of experience with the other side.  And the ingroup categorization mechanism says that contact can reveal or make salient similarities and shared interests that were not apparent before contact.   


Definition of intergroup conflict (Al Ramiah and Hewstone 2013): "Intergroup conflict involves competition for dominance between two or more groups over physical resources, values, and/or claims to status and power (Coser, 1967). Conflict can usefully be thought of as occurring along a continuum. At one end of the spectrum, conflict can manifest as prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination and can
be subtle or take more explicit forms. At the other end of the spectrum, conflict can become both overt and violent and take the form of “ethnic cleansing” and genocide (Fisher, 1994, p. 47).


**Limited opps for non-intervention contact**.
Groups in conflict have limited opportunities for interaction, which leads to prejudice, distrust, and misinformation [@scacco2018nigeria; @enos2016intergroup; @acemoglu2014cycles]


**Group status**
cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.  @ditlmann2016can contact-based intervention did not affect the disadvantaged, minority group.


**Real Problems**
this all supposes groups have overlapping preferences, don't want to hurt each other, are really nice people, etc.  None of that applies to most groups in conflict.  Ekrem: "Rational agents have 100% empathy, but they still fight." (rational agents know what the other guy will do == empathy as it is defined).

Group animosity often arises due to the competition for resources that both groups claim or desire [@sherif1958superordinate].  If competition for resources itself causes poor intergroup relations/negative intergroup attitudes, then competition for resources will cause conflict and intergroup contact will have no effect because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.  With or without structured intergroup contact, the groups are still engaged in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].



**Why contact will still work**
- Important that outgroup status is salient; will be salient in conflict settings.
- Humans are goal-driven. Contact provides opportunities for each group to see that working together helps each group achieve their goals.


**Diffusion**:
Cooperative contact between some ingroup members and some outgroup members can only meaningfully improve group relations if the effects of contact diffuse to group members who do not have direct contact with outgroup members.  Diffusion to other group members occurs in two ways.  First is the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members, either through word of mouth or through observing positive intergroup interactions [@wright1997extended].  The second is changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual].
