# Improving Intergroup Relations Through Cooperative Intergroup Contact

<!--Section goal:  Contact summary + conditions.  Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion.  How contact generalizes/diffuses.  THEN ME: overarching understanding of contact and when it should/should not work.-->

<!--Contact summary + conditions -->

Cooperative intergroup contact has long been posited as a means to improve intergroup relations.  Popularized by Gordon @allport1954prejudice, the contact hypothesis assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup animosity.  Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes will misrepresent groups, create imagined differences between ingroup and outgroup members, and obscure shared interests. To remove these negative stereotypes new experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup.

Allport and subsequent authors specified four conditions under which contact will remove stereotypes and improve intergroup relations.  First, the contact must involve ongoing personal interaction between members of both groups.  Second, both groups must have equal status in the interaction.  Third, the interaction must involve cooperation towards a common goal.  And fourth, the intergroup interaction must have the support of, or at least not be punished by, institutions and authorities.  These conditions ensure positive interactions between group members.

<!--Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion. -->
Allport argued that contact works by enhancing knowledge and overriding negative stereotypes about the outgroup, and subsequent scholarship has identified three additional mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.  First, contact reduces the feelings of threat and anxiety that arise from fear of the unknown [@stephan1985intergroup; @page2008little].  Second, contact enables perspective-taking so that ingroup members empathize with the outgroup [@batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably].  And third, contact makes salient a shared identity based on the groups' similarities and intersts [@gaertner1993common; @gaertner2014reducing].  Through these mechanisms group members can experience positive cross-group interactions, which triggers cognitive dissonance against the preexisting negative attitudes.  Attitudes improve when that dissonance is resolved by rejecting, rather than justifying, negative attitudes towards the outgroup [@gubler2013humanizing].

<!--chris: broke this off from above. something here about typicality and cognitive dissonance.  for attitudes to expand to all outgroup members, dissonance has to be resolved by changing attitudes about the group, not just about the individuals you interact with. chris: here
-->
These mechanisms support the reduction of group-based prejudice for individuals involved in the intergroup interaction, but the positive effects of contact must diffuse to individuals not involved in the interaction for intergroup contact to meaningfully improve intergroup relations.  This diffusion to other group members occurs through changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual] and through the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members [@wright1997extended].  Norms and awareness of cross-group cooperation shows that cross-group interaction is safe and socially encouraged.  It also creates the expectation of future interaction with outgroup members, which motivates individuals to see the outgroup more positively [@klein1992motivated; @van2019actions].  Through social diffusion cooperative contact improves attitudes even for ingroup members with no cross-group contact.

<!--Here is the overarching undestanding of contact.-->
<!--
Taken together, the existing literature suggests that cooperative contact improves intergroup relations by removing psychological barriers -- negative stereotypes, feelings of outgroup threat, and a lack of empathy -- to unbiased perceptions of the other side.  Without perceptual biases groups can interact positively and identify their shared interests.  Cooperative contact facilitates the identification of shared interests by having the groups cooperate towards a common goal.  Positive interactions and the identification of shared interests challenge pre-existing negative beliefs and trigger cognitive dissonance.  Attitudes improve when that dissonance is resolved by rejecting preexisting negative attitudes in lieu of new positive experiences.  Positive attitudes diffuse to other group members through awareness of cross-group cooperation changing social norms.-->

## Cooperative intergroup contact in the context of violent group conflict

<!--focus on the violence.  structure paragraphs around the violence, then explain the psychological mechanisms that the violence causes.  First, recent and PERSONAL history.  Second, ongoing reinforcement. -->

<!--It seems to me that the big difference between the farmer-pastoralist conflict and other contact-amid-conflict papers is that these farmers and pastoralist are active participants in the violence, not just people who belong to groups in conflict.  It is harder for someone to change their attitude about a group when they have personally acted on a negative attitude and when the other group has personally harmed them, as compared to someone who holds a negative attitude but has not acted on it.  If I don’t like Buckeyes and go around punching them when I see them, it will be hard for me to change my attitude about Buckeyes because I would have to come to terms with my own immoral behavior.  If I don’t like Buckeyes but haven’t done anything to them, changing my attitudes does not challenge my self-image. -->

<!--intro paragraph.  The group members continue to be involved in violence.  Continued examples of violence and recent history of violence can cause contact to fail at each step of the process.-->
Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact to improve attitudes.  Even if contact succeeds in providing positive experiences with outgroup members, the resulting cognitive dissonance may not be resolved by embracing positive attitudes.  A recent history of participation in and victimization by violence motivates group members to resolve dissonance by rejecting their new experiences and attitudes, not their pre-existing experiences and attitudes.  And continued cross-group violence provides negative experiences that counter the positive experiences of contact.  These negative experiences reinforce prior beliefs and can block the removal of psychological barriers to identifying shared interests.

<!--Recent history paragraph.
Groups justify perpetrating violence by dehumanizing the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization], and group members must maintain that dehumanization or come to terms with their transgressions.-->
Participation in and victimization by violence in the recent past motivates group members to justify their existing attitudes [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning].  Existing attitudes are harder to reject once an individual has acted on them [@tavris2008mistakes].  Once an attitude is acted upon, rejection of the attitude threatens an individual's self-identity because the the individual must comes to terms with his or her own immoral behavior.  Likewise, individuals are less likely to reject existing attitudes when they have personal experiences that reinforce those attitudes.  In the case of prejudice, prejudiced attitudes are least likely to be rejected when an individual has been personally harmed by the outgroup.  Instead of rejecting negative attitudes, violent experiences can lead indidivuals to resolve cognitive dissonance by justifying previous attitudes [@gubler2013humanizing] or, at best, by differentiating "good" outgroup members from typical outgroup members [@doosje1995bad].

<!--Continuing violence paragraph-->
Beyond violence in the recent past, continued examples of group violence to reinforce pre-existing negative attitudes.  Ongoing violence counters the good experiences from cooperative contact and compromises the mechanisms through which contact is supposed to improve outgroup attitudes / in the context of ingoing violence, cooperative contact may not reduce the psychological phenomenon that cause perceptual biases.  Ongoing violence reinforces outgroup stereotypes and feelings of threat.  Empathy, the ability to take the perspective of the other side, will not improve cross-group relations if taking their perspective reveals incentives to be belligerent [@kertzer2018empathy].    If violence was all in the past, it's plausible that something has changed.  Some scholars believe group reconciliation cannot begin until conflict is resolved [@bar2000intractable].   

reinforce stereotypes, feelings of thread, perceived group differences/ingroup moral superiority, conflicts of interests. various psych mechanisms: confirmation bias; anchoring; motivated reasoning. _Contact is meant to work through reducing stereotypes, creating empathy, reducing threat, and revealing common identities.  But contexts of violence offer plentiful examples that reinforce negative stereotypes about the outgroup, and .    When outgroup members are a genuine threat learning about the outgroup through contact may confirm that they pose a threat, rather than reduce anxiety.  And far from revealing common identities, violence leads to the construction of opposing group identities and reinforces group differences [@fearon2000violence].  For these reasons, violent conflict may override the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes._


<!--negative contact possibility paragraph -->
Individuals also may not even have positive experiences with contact.

_First, individuals will perceive cross-group interactions negatively so that those interactions conform to pre-existing beliefs about the outgroup.  Second, individuals will notice and remember negative interactions that conform to pre-existing views of the outgroup, biasing perceptions of the other side [@ward1997naive]._  





<!--social norms paragraph -->
Social norms prevent rather than facilitate attitude change.  No diffusion.  No support from institutions/authorities.  Seem like a traitor.  _Conflicting groups share emotions of outgroup prejudice and norms that delegitimize the outgroup [@bar2017development].  These pre-existing norms self-perpetuate by discouraging ingroup members with positive attitudes from displaying those attitudes, either through talking about or engaging in cross-group interaction publicly.  With no opportunities to hear about or observe positive cross-group interaction, the effects of contact cannot extend to ingroup members without contact._ 

_groups create narratives that support those stereotypes [@bar2017development]_

<!--but it could still work! paragraph -->
But these barriers do not mean that contact cannot improve intergroup relations for groups in violent conflict.

<!--Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact to improve attitudes.  Cooperative contact is meant to reveal commonalities, but violent conflict occurs due to a conflict of interests, highlights those conflicting interests, and creates further conflicting interests.  Instead of commonalities, contact between these groups may reinforce reasons to fight.-->

<!--chris: trying to add something about cognitive dissonance here.-->
Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact to improve attitudes.  Negative attitude stem from past transgressions and the belief that the groups lack any common ground/interests.  Improving negative attitudes requires the rejection of a pre-existing negative attitude for a dissonant positive attitude [@gubler2013humanizing].  Cooperative contact is meant to reveal common interests and provide provide positive interactions that override negative beliefs, but violent conflict occurs due to a conflict of interests, provides continued examples of conflicting interests that reinforce negative beliefs, and creates further conflicting interests.  Instead of commonalities, contact between these groups may reinforce reasons to fight.

That dissonance is not always resolved by embracing the new positive experiences.  Group members can flatly reject the positive experiences and embrace/cling more closely to their pre-existing negative attitudes.  Group members can also resolve the dissonance by  differentiating their outgroup partners from "typical" outgroup members.  Most likely to happen for people actively participating in or victimized by violent conflict.  Examples of bad outgroup members.  _Motivation to maintain negative belief about outgroup itself because of previous bad things done to outgroup members._

***********


Where commonalities are present, they may not be identified because of two psychological biases: motivated reasoning and cognitive dissonance [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning; @festinger1962cognitiveDissonance].  _Groups justify perpetrating violence by dehumanizing the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization], and group members must maintain that dehumanization or come to terms with their transgressions._  Individual's maintain their negative attitudes in two ways.  _First, individuals will perceive cross-group interactions negatively so that those interactions conform to pre-existing beliefs about the outgroup.  Second, individuals will notice and remember negative interactions that conform to pre-existing views of the outgroup, biasing perceptions of the other side [@ward1997naive].  If an individual's cross-group experience does not correspond to pre-exiting beliefs about the outgroup, the resulting psychological discomfort and cognitive dissonance can cause a backlash and worsen attitudes [@gubler2013humanizing]._

Violent conflict could also block the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.  _Contact is meant to work through reducing stereotypes, creating empathy, reducing threat, and revealing common identities.  But contexts of violence offer plentiful examples that reinforce negative stereotypes about the outgroup, and groups create narratives that support those stereotypes [@bar2017development].  Empathy, the ability to take the perspective of the other side, will not improve cross-group relations if taking their perspective reveals incentives to be belligerent [@kertzer2018empathy].  When outgroup members are a genuine threat learning about the outgroup through contact may confirm that they pose a threat, rather than reduce anxiety.  And far from revealing common identities, violence leads to the construction of opposing group identities and reinforces group differences [@fearon2000violence].  For these reasons, violent conflict may override the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes._

Even if intergroup contact created cross-group friendships for the individuals cooperating, aspects of violent contexts may block generalization of those attitudes to other outgroup members.  Groups in conflict have limited contact, so _any outgroup member engaging in contact my be viewed as atypical and not informative about other outgroup members [@doosje1995bad]._  Conditions of conflict environments may also prevent from indirectly extending to ingroup members without contact.  _Conflicting groups share emotions of outgroup prejudice and norms that delegitimize the outgroup [@bar2017development].  With pre-existing norms that reinforce negative attitudes, cooperative norms that reach all ingroup members are unlikely to form.  These pre-existing norms may also discourage ingroup members with positive attitudes from displaying those attitudes, either through talking about or engaging in cross-group interaction publicly.  With no opportunities to hear about or observe positive cross-group interaction, the effects of contact cannot extend to ingroup members without contact._  

_But these barriers do not mean that contact cannot improve intergroup relations for groups in violent conflict. _ Cooperative contact should improve attitudes towards the outgroup when there exists a latent shared interest to make salient, and conflicting groups share an interest in obtaining peace because fighting is costly [@fearon1995rationalist].  Violence can obfuscate these shared interests latent, but contact can activate them by providing groups with an example of a shared interest that can be reached through cooperation and removing the psychological barriers to identifying shared interests.  Successful cross-group cooperation can generate cooperative social norms that indirectly improve attitudes for group members, even those who do not engage in direct contact.
_Humans are goal-driven. Contact provides opportunities for each group to see that working together helps each group achieve their goals._

<!--Summary -->
<!--Cooperative contact should improve attitudes towards the outgroup when there exists a latent shared interest to make salient.  Shared interests may remain latent because psychological biases prevent groups from identifying opportunities for both groups to benefit from cooperation.  Cooperative contact can help group members identify shared interests, and cooperative social norms can arise when groups identify that cross-group cooperation is good for the group.  However, when groups have no latent shared interests, contact is unlikely to improve group relations.-->

**Limited opps for non-intervention contact**.
Groups in conflict have limited opportunities for interaction outside of contact-based intervention.  Limited contact leads to prejudice, distrust, and misinformation [@scacco2018nigeria; @enos2016intergroup; @acemoglu2014cycles]


**Group status**
cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.  @ditlmann2016can contact-based intervention did not affect the disadvantaged, minority group.


**Real Problems**
this all supposes groups have overlapping preferences, don't want to hurt each other, are really nice people, etc.  None of that applies to most groups in conflict.  Ekrem: "Rational agents have 100% empathy, but they still fight." (rational agents know what the other guy will do == empathy as it is defined).

Group animosity often arises due to the competition for resources that both groups claim or desire [@sherif1958superordinate].  If competition for resources itself causes poor intergroup relations/negative intergroup attitudes, then competition for resources will cause conflict and intergroup contact will have no effect because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.  With or without structured intergroup contact, the groups are still engaged in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

Why mechs are about lack of experience.
- The mechanisms through which contact improves an individual's negative outgroup attitudes assume that the negative attitudes are caused by a lack of experience with the other side.  The information mechanism says that contact allows for personal experiences that override the stereotypes that arise when individuals have little experience with outgroup members.  The anxiety-reduction mechanism says that contact reduces the anxiety that individuals naturally feel towards the unknown.  The perspective-taking mechanism says that contact allows individuals to understand the feelings of the other side, which they could not do due to lack of experience with the other side.  And the ingroup categorization mechanism says that contact can reveal or make salient similarities and shared interests that were not apparent before contact.
