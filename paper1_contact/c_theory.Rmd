# Theory: Improving Intergroup Relations Through Cooperative Intergroup Contact

<!--Section goal:  Contact summary + conditions.  Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion.  How contact generalizes/diffuses.  THEN ME: overarching understanding of contact and when it should/should not work.-->

<!--Contact summary + conditions -->

Cooperative intergroup contact has long been posited as a means to improve intergroup relations.  Initially presented by Gordon @allport1954prejudice, the contact hypothesis assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup animosity.  Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes will misrepresent groups and create imagined differences between ingroup and outgroup members. To remove these negative stereotypes new experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup.

Allport and subsequent authors specified four conditions under which contact will remove stereotypes and improve intergroup relations.  First, the contact must involve ongoing personal interaction between members of both groups.  Second, both groups must have equal status in the interaction.  Third, the interaction must involve cooperation towards a common goal.  And fourth, the intergroup interaction must have the support of institutions and authorities.

<!--Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion. -->

Contact is said to work through four main mechanisms.  The first is an informational mechanism wherein direct experience with outgroup members allows members of each group to see how similar they are and overrides negative stereotypes [@allport1954prejudice].  The second and third are emotional mechanisms.  Intergroup contact reduces the feelings of threat and anxiety that arise from fear of the unknown [@stephan1985intergroup; @page2008little]; intergroup contact also enables empathy so that ingroup members understand the perspective of the outgroup [@batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably].  The fourth is a social categorization mechanism wherein frequent interactions with outgroup members makes salient a shared identity based on the groups' similarities and shared interests [@gaertner1993common; @gaertner2014reducing].  Personal interaction with specific outgroup members then generalize to the entire outgroup if the specific outgroup members are typical of the outgroup (their behavior tells you about the behavior of other outgroup members) [@hewstone1996contact].

<!--How contact generalizes/diffuses. -->

These mechanisms support the reduction of stereotypes for individuals involved in the intergroup interaction.  Since it is not feasible for all members of two groups to interact, the positive effects of contact must diffuse to individuals not involved in the interaction for intergroup contact to meaningfully improve intergroup relations.  This diffusion to other group members occurs via indirect contact, and indirect contact can occur in two ways.  First is the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members, either through word of mouth or through observing positive intergroup interactions [@wright1997extended].  The second is changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual].<!--^[Though the mechanisms through which indirect contact improves attitudes is beyond the scope of this paper, @vezzali2014indirect suggests that anxiety reduction mediates the effects of direct and indirect contact.  Social cognitive theory, which is the theoretical backing of vicarious contact, suggests that individuals adopt behaviors and attitudes that they observe; specifically, when they believe those observed behaviors and attitudes will help them achieve their goals [@Bandura1971], such as fitting in with their group.]-->

<!--Here is the overarching undestanding of contact/common thread; here is what it means for when contact should work and when contact should not.
- cannot think cooperation will be in the group's interest if the other side is untrustworthy and immoral (stereotypes), threatening (threat/anxiety), 
-->

We interpret the existing literature as suggesting that cooperative contact improves intergroup relations when it reveals that the groups have latent shared interests.  Shared interests are goals, values, and other commonalities between the groups.  These interests remain latent due to psychological barriers to identifying those shared interests: negative stereotypes, feelings of outgroup threat, a lack of empathy, and a lack of perceived similarities.  These barriers prevent groups from identifying their shared interests by providing motivation to maintain negative beliefs [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning] and biasing perceptions of the other side [@ward1997naive].  For example, opposing groups perceive the defensive actions of the other side as belligerent and gratuitous while their perceiving own belligerent actions as defensive and justified [@duncan1976differential; @vallone1985hostileMedia].  Even cooperative actions and compromises may be reactively devalued or perceived as cynical attempts to manipulate the ingroup [@ward1997naive; @ross1991barriers].  If each group believes the other group is untrustworthy, immoral, and threatening, both groups are unlikely to believe cooperation could be in their interest.

Cooperative contact removes those psychological barriers to groups identifying their shared interests and makes shared interests salient.  Contact removes psychological barriers by providing experiences with outgroups that override stereotypes, reduce anxiety, present the other side's perspective, and demonstrate cross-group commonalities.  Without negative stereotypes and automatic emotional reactions, groups can identify shared interests if shared interests are present.  The mere expectation of working with outgroup members can even motivate individuals to see group more positively, rather than motivate individuals to maintain negative perceptions [@klein1992motivated].  With those barriers removed groups can identify shared interests, and cooperative contact provides an obvious example of shared interest: a common goal that both groups work towards.  Cooperative contact provides a shared interest and removes the barriers to grops identifying shared interests.

Ingroup members also learn about the outgroup socially as well as personally.  Social learning about the outgroup improves attitudes for all group members, including group members who do not engage in contact.  First, from hearing or observing that fellow ingroup members interact with outgroup members, ingroup members learn about the outgroup and that cross-group interaction is safe and socially acceptable.  Second, cross-group cooperation can create social pressure to cooperate with the outgroup, especially if cooperation is deemed beneficial to the ingroup [@ditlmann2017addressing; @fearon1996explaining].  Third, awareness of cross-group cooperation creates the expectation of future interaction with outgroup members, and that expectation motivates individuals to see the outgroup more positively [@klein1992motivated; @van2019actions].  In these ways, cooperative contact improves attitudes indirectly, even for ingroup members with no cross-group contact.
<!--cooperation that benefits the group should generate group pressure to cooperate, thus creating cooperative social norms.

- see/hear about more outgroup interaction.  Learn it's okay.
    - Group members think: if cross-group contact is good for those ingroup members, it could be good for me, too.
- expectations of contact for them == motivated to be okay with cross-group interaction.
- cooperation good for ingroup == social pressure/norms to cooperate.  Ingroup policing.
-->

<!--Summary -->
Cooperative contact should improve attitudes towards the outgroup when there exists a latent shared interest to make salient.  Shared interests may remain latent because psychological biases prevent groups from identifying opportunities for both groups to benefit from cooperation.  Cooperative contact can help group members identify shared intersts, and cooperative social norms can arise when groups identify that cross-group cooperation is good for the group.  However, when groups have no latent shared interests, contact is unlikely to improve group relations.

<!--Extra stuff from bottom half of this section.
Motivated reasoning should prevent attitude change for two reasons [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning].  First, people are likely to attend to information and observations that echoes their current beliefs, and their interpretations of new information and observations may ignoring contradictory information or frame the information to bolster existing beliefs [@vallone1985hostileMedia].  Second, even if intolerant people understand and interpret a new observed behavior as pro-tolerance, they may reject that information and develop a counter-narrative.  For example, if shown a narrative where a member of a hated out-group interacts amicably with a member of their ingroup, the learner may counter that by thinking of a time when he/she encountered hostility with a member of the outgroup.  Finally, even if the intolerant learner accepts the message, the resulting psychological discomfort and cognitive dissonance may drive the learner _further_ from tolerance [@gubler2013humanizing].-->

Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact.  Cooperative contact works by allowing groups to see their shared interests, but group conflict entails group competition, which highlights groups' opposed interests.  In contexts of violence, learning about the other side may instead reveal misaligned interests.  Competition over values or for resources makes group distinctions salient [cite], and violent conflict is an extreme case of group competition [@al2013intergroup; cite].  Groups in conflict may not perceive any shared intersets, either because there truly are no shared interests or because psychological and social barriers prevent groups from identifying those interests.

Contact is meant to work by reducing stereotypes, creating empathy, reducing threat, and revealing common identities.  Violence reinforces negative stereotypes about the outgroup.  In contexts of violence, learning about the other side may instead confirm that the other side is threatening, rather than dispel negative stereotypes and reduce anxiety.  Empathy/perspective-taking should not improve relations if the other side is expected to be belligerent [@kertzer2018empathy]

Want it to work here.  Important for world.  Hard to test.


Intergroup contact was not originally formulated as a way of improving intergroup relations when interests conflicting; it was originally formulated as a way to diminish prejudice, which @allport1954 differentiated from justified negative feelings towards an "actual menace" (p.8).  Subsequent scholars have noted that intergrop contact may not improve group relations if the groups have genuine conflicts of interests [@forbes1997ethnic; @hewstone1996contact].


**Typicality**
Opposed interests are salient.  Willingness to engage in interaction may mark an outgroup member as atypical.  

Previous negative experience about group == individuals less likely to believe positive experiences with outgroup member are "typical" and so less likely to update about the outgroup; more likely to have good feelings only about the particular people with whom they interact.  even when positive interactions improve attitudes for the individuals who are interacting, the improved attitudes may not be generalized to the outgroup (Doosje et al 1995).

First, ingroup members who cooperate with outgroup members may not perceive those outgroup members as typical of the outgroup due to previous negative experiences with outgroup members; consequently, ingroup members may not use interactions with those outgroup members to update their attitudes about the outgroup as a whole.


**Group status**
cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.

@ditlmann2016can contact-based intervention did not affect the disadvantaged, minority group.


**Real Problems**
this all supposes groups have overlapping preferences, don't want to hurt each other, are really nice people, etc.  None of that applies to most groups in conflict.  Ekrem: "Rational agents have 100% empathy, but they still fight." (rational agents know what the other guy will do == empathy as it is defined).

Real world violence caused by real world problems.  These groups have misaligned incentives.  Literatures in psych, IR, and econ that predict no change after intergroup contact because groups incentives still fundamentally misaligned.  Pastoralists want to graze, farmers do not want them to graze.  Contact not change the fundamental causes of conflict; things that cause conflict also cause negative intergroup attitudes.  Could get peace through negotiation, but no bargaining range.  Could get peace through negotiation, but cannot trust all group members to abide by deal.

Group animosity often arises due to the competition for resources that both groups claim or desire [@sherif1958superordinate].  If competition for resources itself causes poor intergroup relations/negative intergroup attitudes, then competition for resources will cause conflict and intergroup contact will have no effect because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.  With or without structured intergroup contact, the groups are still engaged in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

This concern is heightened for groups in active conflict.  Their negative intergroup attitudes come from real conflict, not the type of prejudice that Allport and others theorized about.  Through contact, you might learn that the other group _does_ favor itself. Learning about the other side is not going to improve relations if incentives are completely misaligned and the other side _does_ want to harm you [@kertzer2018empathy].  Additionally, in contexts of ongoing conflict, there may be few norms against prejudice, and possibly group norms that support this particular intergroup prejudice.  If intergroup contact works by activating "norms against prejudice", contact is unlikely to have an effect for groups in conflict.

**Limited opps for non-intervention contact**

From Scacco: 
- Members of groups in conflict often live under de
jure or de facto residential and social segregation. By
limiting intergroup contact, segregation can intensify
existing prejudices (Enos and Gidron 2016; Kunovich
and Hodson 2002), limit cross-group trust (Kasara
2013), undermine cross-group cooperation (Alexander
and Christia 2011), increase political participation due
to fear of the out-group (Enos 2016), and contribute
to information failures that perpetuate cycles of conflict
(Acemoglu and Wolitzky 2014).


<!--Section 2: Worst case for psychological barriers
    - motivated reasoning
        - more likely to perceive interactions as bad 
        - more likely to notice and remember bad interactions. 
        - Salience of negative events.

    - perpetrating violence dehumanizes the victim-->

Start here.

"Motivated reasoning should prevent attitude change for two reasons.  First, people are likely to attend to information and observations that echoes their current beliefs, and their interpretations of new information and observations may ignoring contradictory information or frame the information to bolster existing beliefs [@vallone1985hostileMedia].  Second, even if intolerant people understand and interpret a new observed behavior as pro-tolerance, they may reject that information and develop a counter-narrative.  For example, if shown a narrative where a member of a hated out-group interacts amicably with a member of their ingroup, the learner may counter that by thinking of a time when he/she encountered hostility with a member of the outgroup.  Finally, even if the intolerant learner accepts the message, the resulting psychological discomfort and cognitive dissonance may drive the learner _further_ from tolerance [@gubler2013humanizing]."  from prospectus.


Conflicting groups dehumanize the outgroup, meaning that they do not acknowledge the outgroup as fully human [@haslam2014dehumanization; @leyens2007infra; @opotow1990moral; @bandura1999moral].  Dehumanized groups are deemed unworthy of moral considerations; they do not deserve empathy, compassion, or fair treatment.  Along with not extending morality to outgroup members, ingroups often view of the outgroup themselves as immoral -- a group without values who cannot be trusted due to their innate moral deficiencies [@weisel2015ingroup; @parker2013lessons; @brewer1999ingroupOutgroup, p.435].  Killing members of the other group causes further dehumanization.

<!--Section 3: Risk of negative contact making things worse-->

violent conflict coincides with a decrease in contact due to danger and social pressure. Limited opportunities for groups to identify those shared interests.  Incidental contact doesn't work -- need the contact to include personal interaction, occur in situation of equal status, etc.

Not all intergroup contact decreases animosity. Negative intergroup interactions lead to more negative attitudes towards outgroup members [@paolini2010negative; @enos2014causal; @condra2019casual], and are most likely to occur for individuals with the most negative outgroup attitudes [@gubler2011diss; @plant2001responses].  Groups in conflict more likely than others to have negative contact experiences.  incidental contact can make things worse (the @enos2014causal cite and the @forbes1997ethnic cite; vanhanen 1999

Even well-structured positive interactions can increase negative attitudes by causing cognitive dissonance in prejudiced individuals, which causes them to cling more strongly to their prejudicial beliefs (Gubler 2011).  Groups in conflict more likely than others to have strong, stable, negative opinions towards the outgroup.

Negative intergroup interactions worsen intergroup relations.  Groups in conflict or with a history of conflict likely have strong, stable, negative attitudes.


Conditions under which contact is positive might not be possible.  Equal status in interactions -- if groups have unequal status in life, how can any interactions be with equal status?  Institutional support maybe for interactions in the contact setting, where interaction is to achieve a goal that both sides have.  But will that institutional support extend to contact in other settings?  And if institutions/authorities have animosity, will norms of tolerance emerge?  

Contact under other conditions -- such as incidental contact, intergroup competition, interactions in which one group has power over the other, elite disapproval of intergroup contact -- is unlikely to improve intergroup relations [@enos2014causal; @forbes1997ethnic] habyarimana et al 2007; vanhanen 1999.]  This concern is heightened for groups in conflict whose incidental interactions are likely antagonistic. **[chris: maybe don't need this here.  Could go in next section]**


From Scacco: 
- Observational evidence from
Jerusalem suggests that when tensions are high, increased
intergroup interactions can actually increase
the probability of violence (Bhavnani et al. 2014).

<!--Section 4: Way forward/why it could still work.
    - if still existence of shared interest then still possibility of cooperative contact highlighting/bringing out that shared interest.  Hard test, not impossible test. -->

But: cooperation in each groups interest; fighting is costly [@fearon1995rationalist].  Cooperative contact to achieve a common goal provides groups with an example of cooperation towards a shared interest, and that experience can make groups imagine future interactions for shared benefit.  Cooperative contact can also remove the psychological barriers to identifying shared interests, such as stereotypes and feelings of threat and anxiety.  Lastly, cooperation in that benefits the group should generate group pressure to cooperate, thus creating cooperative social norms.

Cooperation is generally beneficial.  More can be accomplished with cooperation than working alone.  Cooperation towards a joint goal.  Contact provides opportunities for each group to see that working together helps each group achieve their goals.  Humans are goal-driven.

Cooperative contact reveals group-level benefit, so group members put pressure on other group members to cooperate.

Important that outgroup status is salient; will be salient in conflict settings.

Provide opportunities for interaction and example of cooperation to benefit both groups.  Structure interaction in a way that avoids misperceptions.  Show that working together is possible and advantageous.

## Summary

[If needed, summary of argument.]

The contact hypothesis was devised to explain racial animus in the United States.  It's mechanisms address problems that arise due to lack of experience: replacement of incorrect stereotypes, reduced anxiety due to uncertainty, ability to see things from outgroup's perspective, and seeing a shared identity with the outgroup.  The contact hypothesis is almost always tested on groups who are spatially segregated and have limited opportunities for interaction -- white people and black people, Muslims and Christians, Jews and Arabs^[chris: do Jews and Arabs fit into this?].  These mechanisms may not function for groups with a recent history of negative and violent interaction.  How would contact improve attitudes when negative attitudes are based on negative experience, rather than inexperience?


The animosity between groups can be driven by opposing interests and negative experiences as much as inexperience.  When there is a latent shared interest to be activated/made salient, contact helps reveal that latent shared interest.  Violent past and present, group differences, group animosity, Something that group animosity is preventing the groups from seeing.   Contact should work when there is a latent shared interest to activate.  Mechanisms of contact show how shared interest exists.  

Contact removes barriers to identifying shared itnersts.  Hard to believe there is a shared interest while holding negative stereotypes about the other group, such as their lack of trustworthiness and their ingroup favoritism.  Hard to see a shared interest when interacting with the other group causes anxiety due to feelings of threat.  Hard to see a shared interest when you do not identify any shared identities.  Contact removes these barriers.
