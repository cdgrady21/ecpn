# Theory: Improving Intergroup Relations Through Cooperative Intergroup Contact

<!--Section goal:  Contact summary + conditions.  Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion.  How contact generalizes/diffuses.  THEN ME: overarching understanding of contact and when it should/should not work.-->

<!--Contact summary + conditions -->

Cooperative intergroup contact has long been posited as a means to improve intergroup relations.  Initially presented by Gordon @allport1954prejudice, the contact hypothesis assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup animosity.  Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes will misrepresent groups and create imagined differences between ingroup and outgroup members. To remove these negative stereotypes new experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup.

Allport and subsequent authors specified four conditions under which contact will remove stereotypes and improve intergroup relations.  First, the contact must involve ongoing personal interaction between members of both groups.  Second, both groups must have equal status in the interaction.  Third, the interaction must involve cooperation towards a common goal.  And fourth, the intergroup interaction must have the support of institutions and authorities.

<!--Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion. -->

Contact is said to work through four main mechanisms.  The first is an informational mechanism wherein direct experience with outgroup members allows members of each group to see how similar they are and overrides negative stereotypes [@allport1954prejudice].  The second and third are emotional mechanisms.  Intergroup contact reduces the feelings of threat and anxiety that arise from fear of the unknown [@stephan1985intergroup; @page2008little]; intergroup contact also enables empathy so that ingroup members understand the perspective of the outgroup [@batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably].  The fourth is a social categorization mechanism wherein frequent interactions with outgroup members makes salient a shared identity based on the groups' similarities and shared interests [@gaertner1993common; @gaertner2014reducing].  Personal interaction with specific outgroup members then generalize to the entire outgroup if the specific outgroup members are typical of the outgroup (their behavior tells you about the behavior of other outgroup members) [@hewstone1996contact].

<!--How contact generalizes/diffuses. -->

These mechanisms support the reduction of stereotypes for individuals involved in the intergroup interaction.  Since it is not feasible for all members of two groups to interact, the positive effects of contact must diffuse to individuals not involved in the interaction for intergroup contact to meaningfully improve intergroup relations.  This diffusion to other group members occurs via indirect contact, and indirect contact can occur in two ways.  First is the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members, either through word of mouth or through observing positive intergroup interactions [@wright1997extended].  The second is changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual].<!--^[Though the mechanisms through which indirect contact improves attitudes is beyond the scope of this paper, @vezzali2014indirect suggests that anxiety reduction mediates the effects of direct and indirect contact.  Social cognitive theory, which is the theoretical backing of vicarious contact, suggests that individuals adopt behaviors and attitudes that they observe; specifically, when they believe those observed behaviors and attitudes will help them achieve their goals [@Bandura1971], such as fitting in with their group.]-->

<!--Here is the overarching undestanding of contact/common thread; here is what it means for when contact should work and when contact should not.
- cannot think cooperation will be in the group's interest if the other side is untrustworthy and immoral (stereotypes), threatening (threat/anxiety), 
-->

We interpret the existing literature as suggesting that cooperative contact improves intergroup relations when it reveals that the groups have latent shared interests.  Shared interests are goals, values, and other commonalities between the groups.  These interests remain latent due to psychological barriers to identifying those shared interests: negative stereotypes, feelings of outgroup threat, a lack of empathy, and a lack of perceived similarities.  These barriers prevent groups from identifying their shared interests by providing motivation to maintain negative beliefs [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning] and biasing perceptions of the other side [@ward1997naive].  For example, opposing groups perceive the defensive actions of the other side as belligerent and gratuitous while their perceiving own belligerent actions as defensive and justified [@duncan1976differential; @vallone1985hostileMedia].  Even cooperative actions and compromises may be reactively devalued or perceived as cynical attempts to manipulate the ingroup [@ward1997naive; @ross1991barriers].  If each group believes the other group is untrustworthy, immoral, and threatening, both groups are unlikely to believe cooperation could be in their interest.

Cooperative contact removes those psychological barriers to groups identifying their shared interests and makes shared interests salient.  Contact removes psychological barriers by providing experiences with outgroups that override stereotypes, reduce anxiety, present the other side's perspective, and demonstrate cross-group commonalities.  Without negative stereotypes and automatic emotional reactions, groups can identify shared interests if shared interests are present.  The mere expectation of working with outgroup members can even motivate individuals to see group more positively, rather than motivate individuals to maintain negative perceptions [@klein1992motivated].  With those barriers removed groups can identify shared interests, and cooperative contact provides an obvious example of shared interest: a common goal that both groups work towards.  Cooperative contact provides a shared interest and removes the barriers to groups identifying shared interests.

Ingroup members also learn about the outgroup socially as well as personally.  Social learning about the outgroup improves attitudes for all group members, including group members who do not engage in contact.  First, from hearing or observing that fellow ingroup members interact with outgroup members, ingroup members learn about the outgroup and that cross-group interaction is safe and socially acceptable.  Second, cross-group cooperation can create social pressure to cooperate with the outgroup, especially if cooperation is deemed beneficial to the ingroup [@ditlmann2017addressing; @fearon1996explaining].  Third, awareness of cross-group cooperation creates the expectation of future interaction with outgroup members, and that expectation motivates individuals to see the outgroup more positively [@klein1992motivated; @van2019actions].  In these ways, cooperative contact improves attitudes indirectly, even for ingroup members with no cross-group contact.
<!--cooperation that benefits the group should generate group pressure to cooperate, thus creating cooperative social norms.

- see/hear about more outgroup interaction.  Learn it's okay.
    - Group members think: if cross-group contact is good for those ingroup members, it could be good for me, too.
- expectations of contact for them == motivated to be okay with cross-group interaction.
- cooperation good for ingroup == social pressure/norms to cooperate.  Ingroup policing.
-->

<!--Summary -->
Cooperative contact should improve attitudes towards the outgroup when there exists a latent shared interest to make salient.  Shared interests may remain latent because psychological biases prevent groups from identifying opportunities for both groups to benefit from cooperation.  Cooperative contact can help group members identify shared interests, and cooperative social norms can arise when groups identify that cross-group cooperation is good for the group.  However, when groups have no latent shared interests, contact is unlikely to improve group relations.

<!--Extra stuff from bottom half of this section.
Motivated reasoning should prevent attitude change for two reasons [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning].  First, people are likely to attend to information and observations that echoes their current beliefs, and their interpretations of new information and observations may ignoring contradictory information or frame the information to bolster existing beliefs [@vallone1985hostileMedia].  Second, even if intolerant people understand and interpret a new observed behavior as pro-tolerance, they may reject that information and develop a counter-narrative.  For example, if shown a narrative where a member of a hated out-group interacts amicably with a member of their ingroup, the learner may counter that by thinking of a time when he/she encountered hostility with a member of the outgroup.  Finally, even if the intolerant learner accepts the message, the resulting psychological discomfort and cognitive dissonance may drive the learner _further_ from tolerance [@gubler2013humanizing].-->

Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact to improve attitudes.  Cooperative contact is meant to reveal commonalities, but violent conflict occurs due to a conflict of interests, highlights conflicting interests, and creates further conflicting interests.  Instead of commonalities, contact between these groups may reinforce reasons to fight.  

Where commonalities are present, they may not be identified because of two psychological biases: motivated reasoning and cognitive dissonance [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning; @festinger1962cognitiveDissonance].  Groups justify perpetrating violence by dehumanizing the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization], and group members must maintain that dehumanization or come to terms with their transgressions.  Individual's maintain their negative attitudes in two ways.  First, individuals will perceive cross-group interactions negatively so that those interactions conform to pre-existing beliefs about the outgroup.  Second, individuals will notice and remember negative interactions that conform to pre-existing views of the outgroup.  If an individual's cross-group experience does not correspond to pre-exiting beliefs about the outgroup, the resulting psychological discomfort and cognitive dissonance can cause a backlash and worsen attitudes [@gubler2013humanizing].

Violent conflict could also block the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.  Contact is meant to work through reducing stereotypes, creating empathy, reducing threat, and revealing common identities.  But contexts of violence offer plentiful examples that reinforce negative stereotypes about the outgroup, and groups create narratives that support those stereotypes [@bar2017development].  Empathy, the ability to take the perspective of the other side, will not improve cross-group relations if taking their perspective reveals incentives to be belligerent [@kertzer2018empathy].  When outgroup members are a genuine threat learning about the outgroup through contact may confirm that they pose a threat, rather than reduce anxiety.  And far from revealing common identities, violence leads to the construction of opposing group identities and reinforces group differences [@fearon2000violence].  For these reasons, violent conflict may override the mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.

Even if intergroup contact created cross-group friendships for the individuals cooperating, aspects of violent contexts may block generalization of those attitudes to other outgroup members.  Groups in conflict have limited contact, so any outgroup member engaging in contact my be viewed as atypical and not informative about other outgroup members [@doosje1995bad].  Conditions of conflict environments may also prevent from indirectly extending to ingroup members without contact.  Conflicting groups share emotions of outgroup prejudice and norms that delegitimize the outgroup [@bar2017development].  With pre-existing norms that reinforce negative attitudes, cooperative norms that reach all ingroup members are unlikely to form.  These pre-existing norms may also discourage ingroup members with positive attitudes from displaying those attitudes, either through talking about or engaging in cross-group interaction publicly.  With no opportunities to hear about or observe positive cross-group interaction, the effects of contact cannot extend to ingroup members without contact.  

<!--Section 2: Worst case for psychological barriers. NOTE: now in 1st section.
    - motivated reasoning
        - more likely to perceive interactions as bad 
        - more likely to notice and remember bad interactions.

        "Conflicting groups dehumanize the outgroup .   Killing members of the other group causes further dehumanization.
"
-->

<!--Section 3: Risk of negative contact making things worse
- chris: removed.  not pertinent.

Not all intergroup contact decreases animosity. Negative intergroup interactions lead to more negative attitudes towards outgroup members [@paolini2010negative; @enos2014causal; @condra2019casual], and are most likely to occur for individuals with the most negative outgroup attitudes [@gubler2011diss; @plant2001responses].  Groups in conflict more likely than others to have negative contact experiences.  incidental contact can make things worse (the @enos2014causal cite and the @forbes1997ethnic cite; vanhanen 1999).  Even well-structured positive interactions can increase negative attitudes by causing cognitive dissonance in prejudiced individuals, which causes them to cling more strongly to their prejudicial beliefs (Gubler 2011).  Groups in conflict more likely than others to have strong, stable, negative opinions towards the outgroup.

Conditions under which contact is positive might not be possible.  Equal status in interactions -- if groups have unequal status in life, how can any interactions be with equal status?  Institutional support maybe for interactions in the contact setting, where interaction is to achieve a goal that both sides have.  But will that institutional support extend to contact in other settings?  And if institutions/authorities have animosity, will norms of tolerance emerge?  

From Scacco: 
- Observational evidence from
Jerusalem suggests that when tensions are high, increased
intergroup interactions can actually increase
the probability of violence (Bhavnani et al. 2014).

-->

<!--Section 4: Way forward/why it could still work.
    - if still existence of shared interest then still possibility of cooperative contact highlighting/bringing out that shared interest.  Hard test, not impossible test. -->

But these barriers do not mean that contact cannot improve intergroup relations for groups in violent conflict.  Regardless of other differences, conflicting groups share an interest in obtaining peace.  Fighting is costly and each group is better off cooperating than fighting [@fearon1995rationalist].  Intergroup contact can help groups identify this shared interest, which may not be clear due to misinformation and misperceptions [@fearon1995rationalist; @ward1997naive].  Cooperative contact can remove the psychological barriers to identifying shared interests, such as stereotypes and feelings of threat, by diminishing the perception that all outgroup members are the same [@quattrone1980perception].  Contact to achieve a common goal also provides groups with an example of a shared interest that can be reached through cooperation, and that experience can make groups open to future cooperation.  Cross-group cooperation that achieves a goal in the group's interest can generate group pressure to cooperate and social norms like ingroup policing of actions that harm the outgroup [@ditlmann2017addressing; @fearon1996explaining].

<!--[one paragraph summary of argument.]-->

The contact hypothesis has never been tested programmatically with groups who are in a violent conflict, and violent conflict poses a hard to test for the effects of group contact.  Literatures in psychology [@sherif1958superordinate] and international relations [@powell2002bargaining] would predict no change after intergroup contact because groups' incentives are still fundamentally misaligned and because contact does not reveal information relevant to group bargaining.   @allport1954prejudice himself differentiated prejudice, which contact should diminish, from justified negative feelings towards an "actual menace" (p.8).  Subsequent scholars have noted that intergroup contact may not improve group relations if the groups have genuine conflicts of interests [@forbes1997ethnic; @hewstone1996contact], and violent conflict is a serious conflict of interests.  But contact can still work by revealing latent shared interests and removing barriers to identifying those interests.

Why mechs are about lack of experience.
- The mechanisms through which contact improves an individual's negative outgroup attitudes assume that the negative attitudes are caused by a lack of experience with the other side.  The information mechanism says that contact allows for personal experiences that override the stereotypes that arise when individuals have little experience with outgroup members.  The anxiety-reduction mechanism says that contact reduces the anxiety that individuals naturally feel towards the unknown.  The perspective-taking mechanism says that contact allows individuals to understand the feelings of the other side, which they could not do due to lack of experience with the other side.  And the ingroup categorization mechanism says that contact can reveal or make salient similarities and shared interests that were not apparent before contact.

**Limited opps for non-intervention contact**.
Groups in conflict have limited opportunities for interaction, which leads to prejudice, distrust, and misinformation [@scacco2018nigeria; @enos2016intergroup; @acemoglu2014cycles]


**Group status**
cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.  @ditlmann2016can contact-based intervention did not affect the disadvantaged, minority group.


**Real Problems**
this all supposes groups have overlapping preferences, don't want to hurt each other, are really nice people, etc.  None of that applies to most groups in conflict.  Ekrem: "Rational agents have 100% empathy, but they still fight." (rational agents know what the other guy will do == empathy as it is defined).

Group animosity often arises due to the competition for resources that both groups claim or desire [@sherif1958superordinate].  If competition for resources itself causes poor intergroup relations/negative intergroup attitudes, then competition for resources will cause conflict and intergroup contact will have no effect because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.  With or without structured intergroup contact, the groups are still engaged in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].



**Why contact will still work**
- Important that outgroup status is salient; will be salient in conflict settings.
- Humans are goal-driven. Contact provides opportunities for each group to see that working together helps each group achieve their goals.


**Diffusion**:
Cooperative contact between some ingroup members and some outgroup members can only meaningfully improve group relations if the effects of contact diffuse to group members who do not have direct contact with outgroup members.  Diffusion to other group members occurs in two ways.  First is the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members, either through word of mouth or through observing positive intergroup interactions [@wright1997extended].  The second is changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual].
