# Improving Intergroup Relations Through Cooperative Intergroup Contact

<!--Section goal:  Contact summary + conditions.  Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion.  How contact generalizes/diffuses.  THEN ME: overarching understanding of contact and when it should/should not work.-->

<!--Contact summary + conditions -->

Cooperative intergroup contact has long been posited as a means to improve intergroup relations.  Popularized by Gordon @allport1954prejudice, the contact hypothesis assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup animosity.  Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes will misrepresent groups, create imagined differences between ingroup and outgroup members, and obscure shared interests. To remove these negative stereotypes new experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup.

Allport and subsequent authors specified four conditions under which contact will remove stereotypes and improve intergroup relations.  First, the contact must involve ongoing personal interaction between members of both groups.  Second, both groups must have equal status in the interaction.  Third, the interaction must involve cooperation towards a common goal.  And fourth, the intergroup interaction must have the support of, or at least not be punished by, institutions and authorities.  These conditions ensure positive interactions between group members.

<!--Contact said to work through: knowledge, anxiety, empathy, ingroup expansion. -->
Allport argued that contact works by enhancing knowledge and overriding negative stereotypes about the outgroup, and subsequent scholarship has identified three additional mechanisms through which contact improves attitudes.  First, contact reduces the feelings of threat and anxiety that arise from fear of the unknown [@stephan1985intergroup; @page2008little].  Second, contact enables perspective-taking so that ingroup members empathize with the outgroup [@batson1997empathy; @broockman2016durably].  And third, contact makes salient a shared identity based on the groups' similarities and interests [@gaertner1993common; @gaertner2014reducing].  Through these mechanisms group members can experience positive cross-group interactions, which triggers cognitive dissonance against the preexisting negative attitudes.  Attitudes improve when that dissonance is resolved by rejecting, rather than justifying, negative attitudes towards the outgroup [@gubler2013humanizing].

<!--chris: broke this off from above. something here about typicality and cognitive dissonance.  for attitudes to expand to all outgroup members, dissonance has to be resolved by changing attitudes about the group, not just about the individuals you interact with. chris: here
-->
These mechanisms support the reduction of group-based prejudice for individuals involved in the intergroup interaction, but the positive effects of contact must diffuse to individuals not involved in the interaction for intergroup contact to meaningfully improve intergroup relations.  This diffusion to other group members occurs through changing social norms about cross-group interaction [@paluck2009jsp; @christ2014contextual] and through the knowledge that other ingroup members had positive contact with outgroup members [@wright1997extended].  Norms and awareness of cross-group cooperation shows that cross-group interaction is safe and socially encouraged.  It also creates the expectation of future interaction with outgroup members, which motivates individuals to see the outgroup more positively [@klein1992motivated; @van2019actions].  Through social diffusion cooperative contact improves attitudes even for ingroup members with no cross-group contact.

<!--Here is the overarching undestanding of contact.-->
<!--
Taken together, the existing literature suggests that cooperative contact improves intergroup relations by removing psychological barriers -- negative stereotypes, feelings of outgroup threat, and a lack of empathy -- to unbiased perceptions of the other side.  Without perceptual biases groups can interact positively and identify their shared interests.  Cooperative contact facilitates the identification of shared interests by having the groups cooperate towards a common goal.  Positive interactions and the identification of shared interests challenge pre-existing negative beliefs and trigger cognitive dissonance.  Attitudes improve when that dissonance is resolved by rejecting preexisting negative attitudes in lieu of new positive experiences.  Positive attitudes diffuse to other group members through awareness of cross-group cooperation changing social norms.-->

## Cooperative intergroup contact in the context of violent group conflict

<!--focus on the violence.  structure paragraphs around the violence, then explain the psychological mechanisms that the violence causes.  First, recent and PERSONAL history: Motivation to maintain negative belief about outgroup itself because of previous bad things done to outgroup members/by outgroup members.  Second, ongoing reinforcement. -->

<!--continued + past vio: can prevent positive experiences, i.e. negative contact possibility paragraph -->
Violent group conflict poses a hard test for cooperative intergroup contact to improve attitudes.  First, in the context of ongoing violent conflict, even cooperative contact towards a joint goal may not provide group members with a subjectively positive cross-group interaction.  Due to psychological biases, individuals perceive cross-group interactions negatively so that those interactions conform to pre-existing beliefs; individuals also more readily store and recall negative interactions that confirm pre-existing attitudes than positive interactions that are dissonant with pre-existing attitudes [@nickerson1998confirmation; @ward1997naive].  If individuals perceive cooperative contact negatively, contact could make attitudes worse, not better [@barlow2012contact; @paolini2010negative; @stark2013generalization].<!--  Negative contact worsens attitudes more than positive contact improves attitudes [@barlow2012contact] as individuals are more likely to attribute negative characteristics to the group and see positive things as atypical of the group [@paolini2010negative; @stark2013generalization].-->

<!--Recent history paragraph: can prevent the last step (resolving cog diss by rejecting old beliefs).
Groups justify perpetrating violence by dehumanizing the outgroup [@haslam2014dehumanization], and group members must maintain that dehumanization or come to terms with their transgressions.-->
Even if contact succeeds in providing positive experiences with outgroup members, the resulting cognitive dissonance may not be resolved by embracing positive attitudes.  Participation in and victimization by violence motivates group members to justify their existing attitudes [@kunda1990motivatedReasoning].  Existing attitudes are harder to reject once an individual has acted on them [@tavris2008mistakes; @festinger1962cognitiveDissonance].  Once an attitude is acted upon, rejection of the attitude threatens an individual's self-identity because the the individual must come to terms with his or her own immoral behavior.  Likewise, individuals are less likely to reject existing attitudes when they have personal experiences that reinforce those attitudes.  In the case of prejudice, prejudiced attitudes are least likely to be rejected when an individual has harmed or been harmed by the outgroup.  Instead of rejecting negative attitudes, violent experiences can lead individuals to resolve cognitive dissonance by justifying previous attitudes [@gubler2013humanizing] or, at best, by differentiating "good" outgroup members from typical outgroup members [@doosje1995bad].

<!--Continuing violence paragraph: can prevent removing barriers to identifying shared interests.-->
Beyond past violent, ongoing group violence provides negative experiences with outgroup members that counter the positive experiences provided by cooperative contact.  These negative experiences bolster the psychological barriers to groups' identifying their shared interests.  Rather than dispelling stereotypes and alleviating feelings of threat, negative experiences reinforce negative stereotypes and justify feelings of threat.  Taking the perspective of the other side will not improve cross-group relations if taking their perspective reveals incentives for belligerence [@kertzer2018empathy].  And far from revealing common identities and interests, group violence perpetuates opposing group identities and interests [@fearon2000violence].  To overcome preexisting negative beliefs, individuals need strong and consistent information that counters those existing beliefs -- a signal that the object of their belief has changed [@nickerson1998confirmation].  For that reason, some scholars believe group reconciliation cannot begin until conflict is resolved [@bar2000intractable].
<!--To believe outgroup is different, interactions with outgroup have to be different.  If violence was solely in the past, it's plausible that something has changed.  various psych mechanisms: confirmation bias; anchoring; motivated reasoning.-->

<!--social norms paragraph -->
Social norms are a potent means to change attitudes and behavior, but in contexts of group violence social norms prevent rather than facilitate attitude change [@bar2007sociopsychological; @bar2017development].  These pre-existing norms self-perpetuate by discouraging ingroup members with positive attitudes from displaying those attitudes, either through talking about or engaging in cross-group interaction publicly.  Group members who do not conform to these norms risk being branded as traitors [@bornstein2003intergroup].  With no opportunities to hear about or observe positive cross-group interaction, the effects of contact cannot extend to ingroup members without contact.

<!--but it could still work! paragraph -->
But these barriers do not mean that contact cannot improve intergroup relations for groups in violent conflict.  Conflicting groups share an interest in obtaining peace because fighting is costly [@fearon1995rationalist], and cooperative contact can make that shared interest salient.  Though existing norms likely support negative attitudes, successful cross-group cooperation can generate cooperative social norms because cooperation and peace are in the interest of both groups.  Cooperative contact also shows that the outgroup is composed of differentiated individuals [@rime2011impact], opening the possibility that past negative experiences with a few outgroup members do not characterize the entire outgroup.

**Limited opps for non-intervention contact**.
Groups in conflict have limited opportunities for interaction outside of contact-based intervention.  Limited contact leads to prejudice, distrust, and misinformation [@scacco2018nigeria; @enos2016intergroup; @acemoglu2014cycles]


**Group status**
cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.  @ditlmann2016can contact-based intervention did not affect the disadvantaged, minority group.


**Real Problems**
this all supposes groups have overlapping preferences, don't want to hurt each other, are really nice people, etc.  None of that applies to most groups in conflict.  Ekrem: "Rational agents have 100% empathy, but they still fight." (rational agents know what the other guy will do == empathy as it is defined).

Group animosity often arises due to the competition for resources that both groups claim or desire [@sherif1958superordinate].  If competition for resources itself causes poor intergroup relations/negative intergroup attitudes, then competition for resources will cause conflict and intergroup contact will have no effect because it doesn't change underlying resource competition.  With or without structured intergroup contact, the groups are still engaged in competition for resources, which breeds conflict [@campbell1965ethno; @Sherif1988robbersCave].

Why mechs are about lack of experience.
- The mechanisms through which contact improves an individual's negative outgroup attitudes assume that the negative attitudes are caused by a lack of experience with the other side.  The information mechanism says that contact allows for personal experiences that override the stereotypes that arise when individuals have little experience with outgroup members.  The anxiety-reduction mechanism says that contact reduces the anxiety that individuals naturally feel towards the unknown.  The perspective-taking mechanism says that contact allows individuals to understand the feelings of the other side, which they could not do due to lack of experience with the other side.  And the ingroup categorization mechanism says that contact can reveal or make salient similarities and shared interests that were not apparent before contact.
