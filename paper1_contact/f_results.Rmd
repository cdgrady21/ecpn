# Key Points

- focus on increased contact + security as behaviorally-relevant outcomes, unlikely for SDB; also trust.  Downplay outcomes that confuse the story.
- Intergroup attitudes: trust index, endorsement experiment.
- Intergroup contact: contact index, list experiment, percentile experiment, markets/social events
- Insecurity: insecurity index
    - Awareness of conflict (ask how many conflicts).  Then it's "intervention groups were _more_ aware of conflicts and yet felt more physically secure, despite their heightened awareness."
- Then atts about violence placebo.

- then exploratory about mechanisms.

- Other outcomes?
    - peace_commit: You would personally commit to peace with X group, even if members of X group used violence against your group.

# Results

Our major finding is that the program improved intergroup attitudes, spurred intergroup contact outside of the program, and reduced feelings of insecurity.  The program had the largest impact on respondents who participated on ECPN committees, but the effect extended to respondents who did not participate with ECPN.  We use coefficient plots to report average treatment effects in our community-level data and in our individual-level data.  We also use coefficient plots to show differences between participants, nonparticipants, and controls in our individual-level data.  All coefficient plots show bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals and standardized coefficients.


### Contact

The effect of ECPN on contact is substantial.  [figure1] shows the effect of ECPN on each contact outcome.  Respondents in treatment communities report more contact and more willingness to engage in contact at all levels of the percent experiment; we also observe more pastoralists in markets interacting with farmers.  Since the markets are all located in the farming community, the sustained presence of pastoralists there suggests that (1) farmers were accepting/tolerant of pastoralists in their community and (2) pastoralists felt comfortable spending time in the farmer community.  The number of farmers present in the markets does not change in either group, which makes sense because the market is inside the farming community.

Descriptively, the data show that intergroup contact declined sharply in control communities but rose slightly in treatment communities.  It is impressive that ECPN increased contact while the social environment led to a sharp decline in control sites.  The secular decline is due to the displacement in Benue, where intergroup contact went down for every group, though it declined far less in treatment sites. In Nasarawa, intergroup contact increased in both treatment and control sites, but far more in treatment sites.  

At the individual-level, intergroup contact increased for committee participants but stayed largely the same for nonparticipants and controls.  The large community-level effect, however, suggests that the effects of ECPN _did_ extend to nonparticipants in treatment comunities.  But the effect did not extend to the type of nonparticipant who we could track down and resurvey.

The list experiment coefficient, however, suggests that the program _increased_ dislike of interacting with the other group in markets, relative to the change in the control group.  Descriptively, dislike of interacting with other groups declines in both the treatment and the control group, but the decline is much larger in the control group.  In fact, the list experiment suggests that, on average, _no one_ in the control group is upset about interacting with the other side in markets.  The endline difference between the 4-item and the 3-item list in the control group is slightly negative, implying that the presence of the 4th item slightly decreased the number of reported items.  The endline difference in almost half of communities is negative, indicating that the list experiment failed.

### Insecurity

ECPN's substantially increased feelings of security in the treatment group.  The effect is large in both the community-level and the individual-level data.  At the individual-level, there is no difference between participants and nonparticipants, suggesting that these increases reflect a change in the conflict environment that impacts nonparticipants and participants equally.  These improvements in treatment communities are especially powerful because other survey questions show that ECPN increased awareness of the conflict -- respondents in ECPN communities are more likely than the control to know that violence between groups has occurred recently, yet they feel more secure.

Descriptively, ECPN communities initially felt less secure than control communities but ended up feeling more secure at the end of the program.  The effect is especially large in Nassarawa, where control communities did not increase but treatment communities increased a very large amount.^[chris note: put in the SD effect].

### Intergroup Affect

ECPN also bolstered intergroup affect on .  Respondents answered

Descriptively, affect in control communities decreased from baseline to endline, while intervention communities improved over the same time period.


### Placebo Outcomes

Could be social desirability bias -- respondents in treatment villages learned what the enumerators and NGO wanted to hear.  If so, we should expect effects for dispute resolution, intergroup cohesion, PGG, etc...which we do not see.  Would also expect effects for _the acceptability of violence_.  We measured acceptability of violence with a 5 question index.

## Alternative Mechanisms

**Material Improvement** If the result is explained by the material improvement, we'd expect people who used the borehole to express the most improvement on outcomes.





## Limitations

### Small Number of Communities 

The main limitation of the community-level randomized controlled trial is the number of communities we were able to include in the study. With 30 communities clustered at 15 sites, we have relatively low power to detect an effect of ECPN. We try to increase power by testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously (following Caughey, Dafoe, and Seawright 2017) and by using inverse-covariance-weighted outcome indices,  which should measure our outcomes of interest more precisely than indices constructed using other methods.

### Self-Selection at the Individual Level 

We also initially planned to randomize participation on ECPN committees within intervention communities. However, as discussed above, we had low compliance with the individual-level randomization. As a result, many of the people on the committees self-selected into participation. If we see positive change among committee participants, therefore, it is possible that the type of people who participated would have changed more positively even without ECPN, making it difficult to attribute the change to ECPN. It is also possible that ECPN is effective only on the type of people who elected to participate and would not be as effective on people less interested in the program, making it difficult to generalize the effects of ECPN to the wider population in these areas.

We try to address these concerns in three ways. First, we illustrate that the respondents we resurveyed are not statistically different from baseline respondents on baseline measures. Since the people we resurveyed are an as-if-random sample of all baseline respondents, effects we see in this sample should generalize to other respondents. Second, we demonstrate that on most measures, there are no measurable baseline differences between direct participants, indirect participants, and controls. When there are differences, the control sites start out more positively than intervention sites, which would make it more difficult for us to see an effect (i.e., the differences work against us). Third, we present evidence that these groups do not differ in their baseline-to-endline changes on two placebo outcomes,  suggesting that they have similar trajectories in the absence of ECPN. The results of these balance and placebo tests are presented in Appendix 4. 

### Displacement

An additional limitation of both analyses was the significant displacement in Benue state at the time of the endline. Widespread violence between farmers and pastoralists had forced many of the communities in Benue to flee to safer locations. While we chose randomly among the people we could find, we do not know whether the community members we could locate were somehow different from the broader population in these communities.  Appendix 1 presents evidence that on measured variables, resurveyed respondents in the individual-level analysis are representative of all people from the baseline; we are not able to conduct a similar analysis with the community-level sample. In the discussion section, we provide further explanations for how the interpretation of our results would change if our sample is unrepresentative due to displacement. 

### Program Adaptations

Finally, due to the fluid nature of conflict dynamics and the need to adapt the program when necessary, we were not able to maintain separation between intervention and control sites (i.e., there was contamination). For example, the team conducted an intercommunity peace forum in one intervention site, but community leaders requested that leaders from a neighboring site—which happened to be a control site—attend the forum because of a recent conflict event that had spread across the area. The program team decided to risk contamination of the research by including the control site in that one forum, for the sake of the program’s success. This type of contamination was limited as much as possible, and to the extent that it may affect results of the study, it would attenuate the results, working against our hypotheses rather than in favor of them.
