Summary of typical contact theory stuff. To understand why cooperative
contact might not work for groups in conflict, we must specify the
mechanisms through which contact works and then specify why contextual
factors/conditions somehow block/prevent that mechanism.

How intergroup contact works: - Knowledge effect: experience with
outgroup replaces misperceptions and stereotypes. Hear their perspective
and understand point of view == less prejudice \& no longer attribute
negative motivations to the outgroup. (Allport 1954) - Contact itself:
Familiarity breeds liking (Pettigrew and Tropp 2006) - Expand ingroup to
include the former outgroup (Gaertner and Dovidio 2014) - Reduce
anxiety, uncertainty, and threat (Lee 2001; Page-Gould, Mendoza-Denton,
and Tropp 2008; Paolini et al. 2004; Pettigrew and Tropp 2008) -
Increase perspective taking/empathy for outgroup (Broockman and Kalla
2016; Pettigrew and Tropp 2008)

Diffuse to others through extended contact or social norms.

\hypertarget{how-conflict-could-prevent-relations-from-improving}{%
\subsection{How conflict could prevent relations from
improving}\label{how-conflict-could-prevent-relations-from-improving}}

Contact theory assumes that negative stereotypes cause intergroup
animosity. Stereotypes, natural mental shortcuts that help an individual
understand his/her experiences, are especially likely to go awry and
create animosity when an individual has little or no experience with
members of another group. Without intergroup experience, stereotypes
will misrepresent groups and create imagined differences between
in-group and outgroup members. To remove these negative stereotypes new
experiences must override them, allowing an individual to re-
conceptualize the outgroup.

The mechanisms through which contact improves an individual's negative
outgroup attitudes assume that the negative attitudes are caused by a
lack of experience with the other side. And the contact hypothesis is
almost always tested on groups who are spatially segregated and have
limited opportunities for interaction -- white people and black people,
Muslims and Christians, Jews and Arabs. How does contact work when
negative attitudes are based on negative experience, rather than
inexperience?

The information mechanism assumes minimal previous experience; these
groups have many negative experiences, and many group members have been
directly harmed. Real information about the other side will not decrease
animosity when it is probably true that some members of the other side
want to cause physical harm to your side.

Empathy seems to apply to prejudice that advantaged groups feel towards
disadvantaged, but empathy/perspective-taking should not improve
relations if the other side is expected to be belligerent (Kertzer,
Brutger, and Quek 2018). Anxiety based on unfamiliarity with outgroup is
different than anxiety based on anxiety-inducing previous experiences.

Superordinate identities unlikely for groups in violent conflict, who
will have few shared identities and whose material interests are
opposed.

Negative contact experiences worsen intergroup relations (Paolini,
Harwood, and Rubin 2010). Individuals with the worst attitudes may
experience backlash effects (Gubler 2011).

\textbf{Contact does not change cause of conflict} Real world violence
caused by real world problems. These groups have misaligned incentives.
Literatures in psych, IR, and econ that predict no change after
intergroup contact because groups incentives still fundamentally
misaligned. Pastoralists want to graze, farmers do not want them to
graze. Contact not change the fundamental causes of conflict; things
that cause conflict also cause negative intergroup attitudes. Could get
peace through negotiation, but no bargaining range. Could get peace
through negotiation, but cannot trust all group members to abide by deal

\textbf{Contact could do bad things}

not all intergroup contact decreases animosity. Negative intergroup
interactions increase prejudice and lead to more negative attitudes
towards outgroup members (Paolini et al 2010; Enos 2014; sands 2017;
condra and linardi 2019). Groups in conflict more likely than others to
have negative contact experiences.

Even well-structured positive interactions can increase negative
attitudes by causing cognitive dissonance in prejudiced individuals,
which causes them to cling more strongly to their prejudicial beliefs
(Gubler 2011). Groups in conflict more likely than others to have
strong, stable, negative opinions towards the outgroup.

\textbf{conditions under which contact work are not present}

Conditions must be met for intergroup contact to improve intergroup
relations and reduce violent conflict. First, ingroup members must
generalize their contact with a few outgroup members to the entire
outgroup. Second, the positive effects of contact must diffuse
throughout the ingroup. Third, attitudes of both groups must improve.
Even if contact effectively changes the attitudes of individual group
members, contact cannot have meaningful effects on reducing violent
conflict unless these conditions are met.

These conditions may not be met by groups engaged in violent conflict.
First, ingroup members who cooperate with outgroup members may not
perceive those outgroup members as typical of the outgroup due to
previous negative experiences with outgroup members; consequently,
ingroup members may not use interactions with those outgroup members to
update their attitudes about the outgroup as a whole. Second, even if
contact changes the attitudes of ingroup members who experience contact,
norms that affect other ingroup members may not develop. Liking other
group hard to link to a positive ingroup trait, like morality. Third,
cooperative contact may only improve relations of the more powerful
group towards the less powerful group; the less powerful group may
perceive themselves as victims of the other group's injustice.

\hypertarget{how-contact-can-improve-relations-even-amid-conflict}{%
\subsection{How contact can improve relations even amid
conflict}\label{how-contact-can-improve-relations-even-amid-conflict}}

Contact as opportunity to show that intergroup cooperation is materially
good for both groups.

Contact as opportunity to send costly signal of type: trustworthy, fair,
hard-working.

Contact to foster trade?

Contact to create norm of ingroup policing.

Contact increases likelihood of peace through negotiation: - opportunity
to find bargaining range - opportunity ot build trust that both groups
will abide by deal, sanction ingroup members who defect.
