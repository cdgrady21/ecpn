reconeptualization of the mechanism of contact
building on other theories of contact for IR

overarching fits, but what are the implications of that?

ither alternative explanations that run against the rationalist approach.
that i could address with data.
not directly observing an increase in trust.
MC is an indirect 3rd party.  3rd party helped build the trust. acted as a peace enforcer in minds of people
main empirical findings are at the end of this spectrum.
- certain kinds of people didn't need the well.?

what are implications of theory and implications of alternative arguments?
	- did not decrease threat
	- did not increase cohesion/empathy/enlarge ingroup.
	- did not seem to reduce stereotypes
	- we've known since the truck broke down and kids needed ice cream.  we know conditons,mechanisms are unclear.
	- My study supports a different theory that I bring from IR. Rational actors constrained by institutions.
	- Think about framing of where rationalist approaches comes from (Micro-Econ --> IR).
		- this is a really good idea, very useful in IR conflict.
		- problem of contracts between individual people is an old problem.
		- contribution is not: "Im marrying this thing from IR with this thing from psych"
	- mechanism through which contracts work: trust.  So trust can substitute for a contract.
			- then say: here's how to put this into existing schema/boxes in your mind.
			- not the kind of generalized trust in surveys.  Very concrete trust in other group.
			- more related to the way formal theorists talk about trust in behavoiral games and stuff.
			- i see it having an effect because of this literature on institutions to manage conflit from IR.  All are united in that people have incentives.
			- in small areas with villages and pastures, lots that the state cannot be.  Need a non-state method, like culture or norms or repeated itneractions, to help people cooperate and not have behavior fall into defect-defect equiliria.
				- lots of work on corruption is like this.  How do we climb out of this situation?  And Paluck on bullies.  Need to find ways for humans to self-regulate, or not need a police officer around all the time.
